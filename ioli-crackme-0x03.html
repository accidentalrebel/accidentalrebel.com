        <p>I am continuing my reverse engineering review by tackling the <em>IOLI crackmes</em> by <a href="https://twitter.com/pof">@pof</a>. These are beginner friendly challenges that is perfect for newbies or for those who want to review the basics like me.

<h1 id="getting-the-password">Getting the password</h1>
<p>After opening the program in IDA I immediately saw that the code is almost exactly as the one in challenge <a href="./ioli-crackme-0x02.html">0x02</a>, with the exception of our expected <code>cmp</code> command being inside the <code>_test</code> function.</p>

<p>Reading through the code I realized that the password for this challenge is exactly the same as the previous one!</p>
<p>But what's this? The success and failure messages are all garbled? And plus, what is this other new function called <code>_shift</code>?</p>
<p><img alt="ioli-crackme-0x03-02" src="./images/ioli-crackme-0x03-02.png" /></p>
<h1 id="a-different-kind-of-challenge">A different kind of challenge</h1>
<p>Opening up the <code>_shift</code> function shows us a short, but interesting looking program flow with two branches and one of the branches looping back. It seems we have a <em>loop</em> here that we could investigate.</p>
<p><img alt="ioli-crackme-0x03-03" src="./images/ioli-crackme-0x03-03.png" /></p>
<p>If we look at the input that the function takes we will find out that the strings that are being passed from the <code>_test</code> function are <code>Lqydolg#Sdvvzrug$</code> and <code>Sdvvzrug#RN$$$#=,</code> for the <em>failure</em> and <em>success</em> messages, respectively. This tells us that a cipher is applied to these strings. What cipher it is using is what we'll be trying to find out.</p>
<h1 id="discovering-the-cipher">Discovering the cipher</h1>
<p>The best way to discover the cipher used is to step through the code. We can do it with both static or dynamic analysis, but the latter is way easier.</p>
<p><img alt="ioli-crackme-0x03-04" src="./images/ioli-crackme-0x03-04.png" /></p>
<p>The code above starts with <code>mov eax, [ebp+arg_0]</code> which copies the pointer to the string passed to our <code>_shift</code> function. We then copy that pointer to <code>[esp+98h+Str]</code> which is the memory location pointing to the top of the current stack. This is done so that it can be passed as an argument when we do <code>call _strlen</code>.</p>
<p>After executing, <code>_strlen</code> returns the length of the specified string and is saved to register <code>eax</code>. This is then used in the line <code>cmp [ebp+var_7C], eax</code>. </p>
<p>But what is the value of <code>var_7C</code>? If you scroll up at the start of the subroutine, <code>var_7C</code> is assigned a value of zero. If you know how loops work, you'll realize that this variable is going to be used to hold a counter value. It starts at a value of <code>0</code> and it will eventually be incremented after every loop, which is what is happening at <code>401348</code>.</p>
<p>To make it easy for us to remember this, let's rename <code>var_7C</code> to a more memorable name like <code>var_counter</code>.</p>
<p><img alt="ioli-crackme-0x03-05" src="./images/ioli-crackme-0x03-05.png" /></p>
<p>So going back, to the comparison command <code>cmp [ebp+var_counter], eax</code>, which now translates to <code>cmp 0, 17</code>. <em>17</em> being the length of our failure string <code>Lqydolg#Sdvvzrug$</code>. Since this is not equal it now goes to this next block of code.</p>
<p><img alt="ioli-crackme-0x03-06" src="./images/ioli-crackme-0x03-06.png" /></p>
<p>Now this block is interesting. There's a lot that is happening but the gist of it is that the program gets one character from the input string, with <code>var_counter</code> as an offset. It then decrements that character value by 3, and added to a destination string. I'll be going through the code that I described step by step in the next section.</p>
<h1 id="stepping-through">Stepping through</h1>
<p>So to start, <code>lea eax, [ebp+var_78]</code> loads the address to <code>var_78</code> which in my case points to the address <code>28FE90</code>.</p>
<p><code>mov edx, eax</code> copies that address to <code>edx</code> so we can use it on the next line.</p>
<p><code>add edx, [ebp+var_counter]</code> adds to the address of <code>var_78</code>. Because <code>var_counter</code> is still <code>0</code>, the address remains at <code>28FE90</code>.</p>
<p><code>add eax, [ebp+arg_0]</code> does the same thing as above but this time adding to <code>[arg_0]</code> which contains the address <code>28FF10</code>.</p>
<p><code>movzx eax, byte ptr [eax]</code> copies the byte contained in <code>[eax]</code> or <code>28FF10</code>. In this case that byte contains the value <code>4Ch</code> or <code>L</code> in ASCII. This is the first letter in our failure string <code>Lqydolg#Sdvvzrug$</code>!</p>
<p><code>sub al, 3</code> then substracts 3 to <code>4Ch</code> making it <code>49h</code> which is ASCII for <code>I</code>.</p>
<p><code>mov [edx], al</code> saves the new character to the variable <code>var_78</code> which is the memory location <code>28FE90</code>. At this point in time the content is currently the character <code>I</code>. To make it easy for us to understand the code, let's rename <code>var_78</code> to <code>var_dest</code>. This name is apt because this will be the destination for our shifted ASCII characters.</p>
<p><code>lea eax, [ebp+var_counter]</code> and then <code>inc dword ptr [eax]</code> now increments the value of <code>var_counter</code>, which now makes it an integer value of <code>1</code>.</p>
<h1 id="looping-back">Looping back</h1>
<p>Alright. Now we go back up again to <code>loc_401320</code>. I'm not going to step through each line again, but I will highlight the important parts now that we have looped back.</p>
<p><code>cmp [ebp+var_counter]</code> now translates to <code>cmp 1, 17</code>, which is still not equal.</p>
<p><code>add edx, [ebp+var_counter]</code> now adds 1 to our <code>var_dest</code> variable, turning <code>28FE90</code> to <code>28FE91</code>. The address for the <code>arg_0</code> variable is also added by 1 at <code>add eax, [ebp+arg_0]</code>.</p>
<p>By the time <code>movzx eax, byte ptr [eax]</code> is executed it now gets the next character in our failure string which is <code>71h</code> or the letter <code>q</code>.</p>
<p><code>sub al, 3</code> converts are letter <code>q</code> to the letter <code>n</code>. And is once again saved to our <code>var_dest</code> variable with the command <code>mov [edx], al</code>.</p>
<h1 id="repeat-until">Repeat until...</h1>
<p>If I haven't lost you, then you should now be able to follow what will happen in the next steps:</p>
<p><code>var_counter</code> will get incremented again and again, which will point to the next characters in the string. For example, the next characters: <code>y</code> then <code>d</code> then <code>o</code> will get shifted to <code>v</code> then <code>a</code> then <code>l</code>, respectively. This shifting of each characters will continue until <code>cmp [ebp+var_counter</code> equates to <code>cmp 17, 17</code>. </p>
<p>By the end, <code>var_dest</code> now contains the newly shifted string <code>Invalid Password!</code>. Finally! Applying the same code above to the success message, the garbled message would end with <code>Password OK!!! :)</code>.</p>
<p>Wasn't that fun?</p>
<h1 id="on-to-the-next-challenge">On to the next challenge</h1>
<p>I hope I was able to explain properly the simple shifting algorithm used by the program above. I did it this way mostly for my own benefit and to make sure I really did understand how the algorithm worked in assembly. In future writeups I'll refrain from stepping through code at such a granular level, unless there is something really important that warrants it. Or maybe a video would be a much better format for these kinds of challenges?</p>
<p>Anyway, I look forward to the next challenge. Hopefully, you are too!</p>
