<p>Your AI assistant might be working for someone else this week. Check Point showed that Copilot and Grok can be quietly repurposed as C2 channels. A supply chain attack on Cline installed autonomous agents on developer machines. And an AI found twelve zero-days in OpenSSL that humans missed for decades. Hard to tell where "AI tool" ends and "attack tool" begins anymore.</p>

<p>Anthropic's latest model identified more than 500 previously unknown high-severity vulnerabilities in major open-source projects like Ghostscript through automated security analysis. The model achieved 65.4% on Terminal-Bench 2.0 (highest ever recorded) and outperforms GPT-5.2 by ~144 ELO points on enterprise knowledge work tasks. Organizations relying on these libraries should monitor for patches.</p>

            <p>I've been using Claude Code for a while now, and I noticed a pattern: at the end of a productive session, I'd have this vague sense of "we figured out some useful stuff" but no concrete record of what those lessons actually were.</p>
<p>Recently, I learned of a skill called <a href="https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/tree/main/skills/continuous-learning">continuous-learning</a>. It automatically extracts reusable patterns and saves them as skills. But I wanted something different. Not automated pattern extraction, but a human-readable summary I could actually share.

<li>Packed malware machine learning classifier can only previously identify 10 packers</li>

<li>It works with a slight caveat of more extended training and processing, which I could happily live with</li>

<p>I recently presented <a href="https://packers.vgl4nt.com/">VGL4NT</a>, my tool that uses machine learning to classify packed malware, at the Blackhat Middle East and Africa meetup. During my talk, I candidly shared one of the tool's limitations which is it can only identify 10 packers because of my hardware constraints. If I want it to be able to identify more, I need to get more GPU (which will be costly) or keep my money and come up with a clever solution. Well, this post is about the latter.</p>

            <p>In the <a href="./malware-sandbox-evasion-in-x64-assembly-by-checking-ram-size-part-2.html">previous post</a>, I explored a sandbox evasion technique that uses <code>GetPhysicallyInstalledSystemMemory</code> to check the size of the RAM of the machine. The idea behind this technique (MBC Technique ID: <a href="https://github.com/MBCProject/mbc-markdown/blob/master/anti-behavioral-analysis/virtual-machine-detection.md">B0009.014</a>) is that any value that is lower than 4GB <em>may</em> probably be a sandbox (to reduce costs). This information can then be used with other sandbox evasion techniques to confirm.</p>
<p>For part 2 of this series, I'll be talking about an alternative Windows API function called <code>GlobalMemoryStatusEx</code>. This function is as straightforward as the first one, but requires the passing of a pointer to a C struct. This is significant because I'll be converting a working C code to x64 assembly so we can fully understand how it works under the hood.</p>
<h2 id="using-globalmemorystatusex">Using GlobalMemoryStatusEx</h2>
<p>Here is an example of an implementation of <code>GlobalMemoryStatusEx</code> in C that we'll later be converting to x64 assembly.</p>

            <p>During my malware sandbox evasion research, I stumbled upon the <a href="https://unprotect.it/">Unprotect Project</a> website. It is a community-contributed repository of evasion techniques used by malware. I saw that the the <a href="https://unprotect.it/technique/checking-memory-size/">Checking Memory Size technique</a> doesn't have a example snippet yet so I figured this would be a good first contribution to the project.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-expect">What to expect</h2>
<p>In this blog post I'll be making a code snippet that showcases how to get the size of a computer's RAM in C. I will then convert this code into x64 assembly, mostly for me to practice writing in it, but also so that we can understand it better.</p>
<h2 id="checking-the-memory">Checking the memory</h2>
<p>The idea behind this evasion technique is simple. Most modern user machines will have at least around 4GB of RAM. Anything lower than that can be an indication that the machine is probably a sandbox (To save costs). While it's not exactly fool-proof …</p>
