<p>Your AI assistant might be working for someone else this week. Check Point showed that Copilot and Grok can be quietly repurposed as C2 channels. A supply chain attack on Cline installed autonomous agents on developer machines. And an AI found twelve zero-days in OpenSSL that humans missed for decades. Hard to tell where "AI tool" ends and "attack tool" begins anymore.</p>

<p>An attacker compromised Cline CLI's npm publish token through a technique called "Clinejection." The clever part: they injected prompts into GitHub issues that tricked Claude (Cline's issue triage AI) into executing commands, then poisoned the build cache and stole publication secrets. The malicious version 2.3.0 ran a postinstall script that globally installed OpenClaw, an autonomous AI agent framework, on roughly 4,000 developer machines over an 8-hour window …</p>

            <p>I've been using Claude Code for a while now, and I noticed a pattern: at the end of a productive session, I'd have this vague sense of "we figured out some useful stuff" but no concrete record of what those lessons actually were.</p>
<p>Recently, I learned of a skill called <a href="https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/tree/main/skills/continuous-learning">continuous-learning</a>. It automatically extracts reusable patterns and saves them as skills. But I wanted something different. Not automated pattern extraction, but a human-readable summary I could actually share. Something I could look back on, or turn into a blog post.</p>
<p>So I built the <a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel/claude-skill-session-retrospective">session-retrospective</a> skill.</p>

<li>Packed malware machine learning classifier can only previously identify 10 packers</li>
<li>Solution was a customized version of model ensembling, which is to train multiple models and resolve their results</li>
<li>It works with a slight caveat of more extended training and processing, which I could happily live with</li>

During my talk, I candidly shared one of the tool's limitations which is it can only identify 10 packers because of my hardware constraints. If I want it to be able to identify more, I need to get more GPU (which will be costly) or keep my money and come up with a clever solution. Well, this post is about the latter.</p>

            <p>In the <a href="./malware-sandbox-evasion-in-x64-assembly-by-checking-ram-size-part-2.html">previous post</a>, I explored a sandbox evasion technique that uses <code>GetPhysicallyInstalledSystemMemory</code> to check the size of the RAM of the machine. The idea behind this technique (MBC Technique ID: <a href="https://github.com/MBCProject/mbc-markdown/blob/master/anti-behavioral-analysis/virtual-machine-detection.md">B0009.014</a>) is that any value that is lower than 4GB <em>may</em> probably be a sandbox (to reduce costs). This information can then be used with other sandbox evasion techniques to confirm.</p>
<p>For part 2 of this series, I'll be talking about an alternative Windows API function called <code>GlobalMemoryStatusEx</code>. This function is as straightforward as the first one, but requires the passing of a pointer to a C struct. This is significant because I'll be converting a working C code to x64 assembly so we can fully understand how it works under the hood.</p>

            <p>In <a href="string-av-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-1">my last blog post</a>, I discussed a way to hide parameter strings from being detected by an anti-virus. The solution was simple and it worked. However, it was incomplete as strings of function calls and loaded DLLs were still detectable in memory.</p>

<p>In this post I'll be talking about the other technique from the same <a href="https://blog.scrt.ch/2020/07/15/engineering-antivirus-evasion-part-ii/">blog post</a> we were following before. It does a good job of explaining the concept which I'll be covering here too. I will also be writing the code in assembly as an added bonus, so we can better understand what goes on under the hood.</p>
<h2 id="the-problem">The problem</h2>
<p>Let's revisit our code from the last time. We have two functions being called <code>ShellExecuteA</code> and <code>ExitProcess</code>.</p>
