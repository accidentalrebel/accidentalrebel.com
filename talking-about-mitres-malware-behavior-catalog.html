<h2 id="a-brief-overview">A brief overview</h2>
<p>MBC is a framework made by Mitre, similar to ATT&amp;CK, but focuses on malware. It lists down the common objectives and behaviors commonly seen in malware. The purpose is to have standardize reporting so that everyone would use the same definitions when writing and talking about malware. This also aids with analysis and correlation with other tools.</p>
<p>It has it's own matrix with malware objectives as headers for columns and an entry for each behavior. Each behavior then has a list of methods that explains how that behavior is achieved, example of malware that uses it, and also IDs of ATT&amp;CK techniques related to the behavior.</p>
<p><img alt="talking-about-mitres-malware-behavior-catalog-02" src="./images/talking-about-mitres-malware-behavior-catalog-02.png" /></p>
<h2 id="the-tools">The tools</h2>
<p>There are a number of existing tools that make use of MBC. <a href="https://github.com/mandiant/capa">Flare's Capa</a> lists down MBC along with the related ATT&amp;CK techniques and there's also a repository of MBC community rules for the Cuckoo Sandox.</p>
<p>I find MBC to have a lot of potential so I decided to contribute by making my own tool called <a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel/mbcscan">MBCScan</a>. It's a simple tool that uses Capa which scans a supplied file and lists the MBC behaviors and objectives associated with it. It also allows you to explore the related information and relationships directly from the command line.</p>

<h2 id="the-future">The future</h2>
<p>MBC has been around for a number of years already but it still has not risen in popularity. In spite of this, it's still being continuously updated. I hope that by sharing and talking about it it'll help spread awareness and, hopefully, get some adoption.</p>
<p>You can find more information about the project via this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZef-SoREdY">video presentation from Mitre</a>.
