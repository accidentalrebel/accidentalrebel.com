## Software/Frameworks
* [jpod101-dl](https://github.com/accidentalrebel/jpod101-dl) - Lessons downloader for [JapanesePod101.com](https://www.japanesepod101.com/) using Python. I like my lessons to be offline so I could access them when I'm out and don't have internet.
* [ABPlayer Mini Helper (2019)](https://github.com/accidentalrebel/abplayer-mini-helper) - Python helper script that cuts audio books in smaller chunks for the ABPlayer hardware project. A really simple solution that is tailored for the needs of it's accompanying hardware, the [ABPlayer Mini Audiobook Player](https://hackaday.io/project/168330-abplayer-mini-audiobook-player).
* [HG180U Parental Control Helper Script (2019)](https://github.com/accidentalrebel/HG180U-Parental-Control-Helper-Script) - An improvement to the PLDT Router Parental Control project I made ealier in the year. This was made because PLDT upgraded our internet router which made my old code not work anymore. This project involved a lot of reverse engineering of the router.
* [Emacs Slack CLI (2019)](https://github.com/accidentalrebel/emacs-slack-cli) - An emacs package that interfaces with the [Slack-CLI](https://pypi.org/project/slack-cli/) python library.

,* [PLDT Router Parental Control (2019)](https://github.com/accidentalrebel/PLDT-Router-Parental-Control) -A simple python script to manage the Parental Control system of a PLDT Home DSL router. I made this so I could control easily the schedule when the kids are allowed to access the internet.
* [HBDDianne (2018)](https://github.com/accidentalrebel/HBDDianne) - A project I made as a gift for Dianne's birthday. This is the first project I made that uses Python, a language that I have long wanted to try out.
* [csv-to-json (2018)](https://github.com/accidentalrebel/csv-to-json) - My very first fully working Rust project. This tolo has been very helpful for me as we mostly work with CSV and JSONs on MindCake.
* [Emacs Dokuwiki (2018)](https://github.com/accidentalrebel/emacs-dokuwiki) - Allows easy editing of Dokuwiki pages. This is my second package that got accepted into the [Melpa repository](https://melpa.org/#/dokuwiki).
* [Emacs Unicode Picker (2017)](https://github.com/accidentalrebel/emacs-unicode-picker) - A visual picker tool that makes searching and picking unicode characters easier. It's a neat and simple idea that I have not gotten around to using for future Emacs games.
* [Coordinate.el (2017)](https://github.com/accidentalrebel/coordinate.el) - A simple Emacs package that allows easy editing of buffers using col and row coordinates. This was supposed to be part of a planned game engine that will run on Emacs, but did not come to fruition.
* [Emacs Haxe Imports (2017)](https://github.com/accidentalrebel/emacs-haxe-imports) - Code for dealing with Haxe imports based on java-imports. This is my first Emacs package that got accepted into the [Melpa repository](https://melpa.org/#/haxe-imports).
* [Emacs Haxe Tools (2017)](https://github.com/accidentalrebel/emacs-haxe-tools) - Because Haxe is becoming my main programming language during this time, I made these collection of Emacs lisp utilities to imrove my development environment.
* [MeowCat Twitter Bot (2016)](https://github.com/accidentalrebel/MeowCatTwitterBot) - A Twitter Bot that sends a reply whenever someone uses the #meow hashtag. Uses iMacros similar to PH Spell Checker Bot.
* [PH Spell Checker Twitter Bot (2016)](https://github.com/accidentalrebel/PHSpellCheckerTwitterBot) - A Twitter Bot that sends a message if someone misspells "Philippines" on Twitter. This is a fun project that uses the [browser automation tool iMacros](https://imacros.net/), it's a pain to code though.
* [B2FTP (2015)](https://github.com/accidentalrebel/B2FTP) - B2FTP (Build to FTP) is a simple command line interface to upload build files to FTP. This is my first foray into using Neko with Haxe in the hopes of making cross-platform tools for my projects.

* [Flame-AnimatedSprite (2015)](https://github.com/accidentalrebel/Flambe-AnimatedSprite) - A simple class for playing animations using a group of single images as an alternative to using Flump. Flambe uses Flump, a good animation tool. But some projects just need a simple animation system and this is my solution.
* [Flambe-AutoStageResize (2014)](https://github.com/accidentalrebel/Flambe-AutoStageResize) - A simple test project that uses a MainStage.hx class to auto resize Flambe games. This is the project where I really gave a lot of thought for a dynamic resizing screen that would work on any mobile phone screen size. All my future game frameworks use this system in one form or another.
* *Flambe-WebText (2014)(Closed source)* - At Indigo, a client needed dynamic texts that can do various transformations (scale, rotate, etc) which were not supported by Flambe at that time. This is my solution that used a separate HTML5 canvas displayed on top of the game and is using HTML5's native text system.
* *Flambe-VideoOverlay (2014)(Closed source)* - At Indigo, a client wanted a way to play videos on top of a game. Unfortunately, the Flambe game engine did not have a way to play videos. This is my solution that uses an external HTML5 video player that plays on top of the game as an overlay.
* [JKEngine (2013)](https://github.com/accidentalrebel/JKEngine/tree/master) - A game framework I made that contains tools and utilities to make making HaxeNME games easier. The first of many engine frameworks I would make for different game engines.

If not their devices won't have access to the internet. This would integrate with the net [parental control script](https://github.com/accidentalrebel/HG180U-Parental-Control-Helper-Script) that I've made a year back.
* [ABPlayer Mini - Audiobook Player (2019)](https://hackaday.io/project/168330-abplayer-mini-audiobook-player) - My phone broke and I couldn't listen to my audiobooks so I made this dedicated device so I don't need a phone at all! It uses a well known MP3 player module but everything else I had to design myself. It is especially fun designing and fitting all the components together onto my case.
* [Recfie - Dedicated Selfie Recorder (2019)](https://hackaday.io/project/168246-recfie-dedicated-selfie-recorder) - I repurposed an old dashcam to make it into a manually activated selfie recorder htat sits on my desk. Taught me how to debug existing circuits and also taught me how fragile ribbon cables and other components are. 
* [TinySwap (2019)(Unfinished)](https://hackaday.io/project/167933-tinyswap-modular-handheld-game-console) - An ATTiny85 handheld game console designed to have detachable and swappable controls. I made a 3D model using SketchUp to visualize how I wanted the conole to look like. It is currently abandoned as my attention was directed towards the making of Recfie.
* [TIRO Vibrating Watch (2019)](https://hackaday.io/project/164144-tiro-vibrating-watch) - TIRO (Time is Running Out) is a watch that vibrates every few minutes to remind the user that time in this world is quickly running out. I spent a lot of time properly learning the basicn of electronics. It gave me the knowledge I needed to properly design a circuit that would fit as a small wearable.
* [Poor Man's 3D Printer (2019)](https://hackaday.io/project/164828-poor-mans-mini-3d-printer) - A 3D printer from scratch using upcycled CD drives, hard drives, and an ATX power supply. This has been done before but resources are limited so I had to research a lot on how to make this. I had to deal with dissasembly, structural integrity, electronics, and calibration which taught me a lot. A really fun project.
* [Hakko T12 Soldering Station (2019)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1hUwdf8SyQDWxSyOlQouAF_q_7oK1ztHq) - A soldering iron station knockoff of the Hakko T12. This is the very first electronics kit that I assembled. Made me realize the value of kits both economically and efficiency.
* [ATTiny85 Programmer (2018)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1DnCU1twQmaF1s-ytL65vxjpSn2fWzn2N) - A simple circuit to program an ATTiny with an Arduino. Nothing fancy but it did let me work with protoboards and practice my soldering.
* [ATX Bench Top Power Supply (2018)](https://youtu.be/1I604n_ANz8 ) - A bench top power supply I built by connecting things together to power my electronics projects. Was intimidating to work with high voltages but proper research and safety helped me stay un-electrocuted.
* [Heartbox (2018)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1V_uxK-zisqvBlNXG0Q6taKJmoq1vB1zS) - The project that started my electronics journey. I wanted to make a special gift for Dianne for our anniversary. Raila had this toy with blinky leds so I took them out wired them together to battery which led to this.

## Physical stuff
* [Plant Holders (2020)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1U-lmLjfRYDnd2ZyREdtA6dC8HW0KhFqT?usp=sharing) - Wife started her plant hobby and I wanted to support her. So I made these plant holders to give her best plants elevation away from the reach of cats.
* [Wooden Succulent Pot (2020)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1J9rzoGbY7qCMn-VjJ7-Bm5Xvb43-BwvZ) - Instead of roses I decided a succulent plant is a better gift for valentines. I made this wooden succulent pot using scrap lumber. Making the hole in the middle took a very long time because of the busted batteries on my drill. This is what led me to work on the Corded Cordless Drill project.
* [DIY Crutches (2020)](http://karlo.licudine.me/i-made-my-own-wooden-crutches.html) - My Plantar Fasciitis struck again. Instead of spending money to buy crutches I just made my own. It's my own personal design, it's ugly but it works.

* [Phone Holder Stand (2019)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1KAfW9umY3lJu3KkVj4c2pTslYQ47TmME) - I found this simple design for a phone holder so I replicated it. It works surprisingly well in spite of its simplicity. Learned about proper carving and finishing on this project.
* [Lamp Base (2019)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1mwopZRvuh-ZgzS1B2aDPWgAjSc2a9z0k) - My very first finished woodworking project. I had limited tools at this time so I decided to go with something simple. I added a carving to not make it too bare. Turned out really nice.
* [Roman Workbench (2019-Ongoing)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=14isWbs_Anu37l2g4yeJ1X5RbZhu_Q9Cg) - When I got interested in woodworking it was suggested that the best first project is a work bench. So I made one. It is still unfinished but it is already usable.

This was the first time I worked with foam and the first time I made a costume prop. A great learning experience that made me think about doing more with my hands.

## Art/Design/Comics
* [Various artworks (2008-onwards)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1-q7mmIolHX43S_CLanT4uz3-tu6BN-He) - Various artworks accumulated throughout the years. The files in the link are not sorted properly but you can still get a sense of how I improved. Plus, notice how I adapt different art styles.
* [Dorm Room (2014)](https://imgur.com/cd0OuYG) - A pixel art representation of my dorm room at college. This one took me awhile to make because of it's isometric perspective but it was a lot of fun to do. [I posted it on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelArt/comments/20vghu/oc_an_iso_pixel_art_of_my_college_dorm_room/) and people liked it.
* [Detective Rizal Game Art (2011)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1EXEmjLJ4n-Id_yl2s1HWEv_yfAOO2Uxk) - Artwork that I've made for the Detective Rizal game I was working at the time. Really pushed myself to the limits of my abilities. Made me realize that I'm much better at programming than making art.
* [Witch Battles Game Art (2011)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCl1vGeUfEQ) - Partnered with a programmer to work on a game idea that did not pan out. Had fun designing characters and levels though.
* [Various client web design projects (2010-2012)](https://www.behance.net/karlolicudine) - I was fortunate to have landed a number of web design client projects during my last few years in college. All of them weer through word of mouth and friends. This stint gave me a lot of pocket money but making websites were not as exciting as making games so I stopped doing it.
* [Buhay Kubo Comics (2009)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gYIjsc6-gtJWHldd6OJ6BOj-EAVSuEvd) - My comic strip featuring a group of friends loosely based on the experiences of my own group of friends. I later realized that I am not good at making jokes. I can come up with a few, but it's too much work for me to come up with one. I was only able to save a few strips from my old Plurk timeline. The other 4 or 5 strips are now completely gone.
* [Blogcomics.net (2009)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1GMAfMm9vcylaYSQwOq5z42f02s3eFBt2) - A blog containing comics on the topic of blogging and current events. Not my best work but I did try. Some comics can now be considered out-of-taste so I decided to leave them out.
* [Untitled Abstract Painting (2009)(Unfinished)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1qp1NpWoF8y51-i0gbhjGpfxY2E1L0wfB) - I've never painted before so this was my first and only attempt. As much as I enjoyed doing this, digital art is more my jam.
* [Rampage (2006-2007)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1zm9_jqQ1lN_-ReC8X1UCB4Lm9UOfjIMK) - When I was a writer at our college's newspaper I took over a section of our paper called _Rampage_ and made my own twist on it. It's a spot the difference game that had increasingly complex sceneries after every issue.
* *The lost files (2006-2010)* - I had a DeviantArt account where I posted a lot of my artworks. But I deleted the account and did not make a backupp of my works. Now they are gone and I couldn't find them anymore.

## Video Editing/Film/Animation
* [IGDA Manila November Meetup (2015)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=199bpUgVmSl_HgJP3ONyWdAzVsc4GmYx4) - Back to a simple video. I think I used Shotcut to edit this video. I was still learning hence the really crude animations.
* [IGDA Manila Mini Game Jam Highlights (2015)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XTx4LmMbuSSz_alYFfDiY7HnRcsrTf76) - This time I tried an "event recap" style of video with interviews for the event. This one had a bit of production preparation so it turned out good. I wish to make more interview/documentary style videos.
* [IGDA Manila August Meetup (2015)](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1rN65UehD0DkEr0Z5JEgHVIhYtMtICfjD) - Another test project to practice video editing. This time I made a teaser trailer for an the August meetup of IGDA Manila.

* [Run Burger Run Advertisement Animation (2012)](https://youtu.be/UDd4f6eoMaI) - We were planning a giant burger eating contest for our _Run Burger Run_ business, I made this video animation as an advertisement for the event.
* [Noooooooo~ (2003)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zP8BFQ_HCY8) - Give a group of friends a camera and lots of free time and this is the result. I did not make the video but I did star in it.

## Podcast
* [Barkada ni Rizal Podcast (2001)](https://soundcloud.com/barkadanirizal) - I was really into listening to podcasts so I convinced my barkada to record our conversations so I could post it online. The result is a fun mess with awful audio but funny banter.

## Business
* *Zalvajeh (2016)* - Dianne and I got into vaping so we thought of selling vape items and accessories to Dianne's workmates. Business was good until Dianne had to change jobs which cut our ties off with our customers. I have no link to the website or the Facebook pages anymore because we had to take them down due to the recent law against Vaping.
* [Kiddle (2012)](https://www.pressreader.com/philippines/philippine-daily-inquirer-1109/20120511/283364764083268) - During Startup Weekend Manila I grouped up with some random individuals at the event and came up with the idea for Kiddle, a web-based app that keeps track of tasks of kids and gives gives virtual rewards when they are completed. We won first prize and was given a chance to build the actual application afterwards. Sadly, I was busy at school so the business never picked up.
* [Run Burger Run (2011)](https://www.facebook.com/runburgerrun/) - My friends and I started a burger business together. We funded and did everything ourselves. We were able to sell at the Mercato Centrale food park in Taguig. We were not able to continue after being muscled out by competition. Regardless, a fun and humbling experience for me.
