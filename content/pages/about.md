# Hey, I'm Karlo.

Most people online know me as **AccidentalRebel**. I work in security, build tools, and write about what I find.

By day, I lead L2 security operations for a 24/7 SOC and run a content engineering team at [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com), where we build hands-on security training used by 3M+ people worldwide. Before cybersecurity, I spent 10+ years as a software engineer: games, web apps, dev tools, low-level systems. I think like an attacker, but I build for defenders.

## What I Do

I sit at the intersection of **security** and **AI**. That means:

- **Detection engineering and threat hunting.** Building and tuning detections in Microsoft Sentinel, investigating what the automated systems miss.
- **Security tool development.** I don't just use tools, I build them. [VGL4NT](https://github.com/accidentalrebel/vgl4nt) (ML-based malware classification), [shcode2exe](https://github.com/accidentalrebel/shcode2exe) (shellcode analysis), [Claudecker](https://github.com/accidentalrebel/claudecker) (AI agent containment), and others.
- **AI x Security.** Exploring how AI changes both sides of the security equation, from AI-powered detection to AI as an attack surface.

## What I Write About

Every week I publish a [Cybersecurity x AI News Roundup](/category/cybersecurity-x-ai-news-roundup.html). Curated analysis of where AI and security collide, with editorial commentary drawn from hands-on experience. No hype, no vendor pitches, just what matters and why.

I also write deep dives on malware analysis, reverse engineering, and the tools I build along the way. If you've taken a room at TryHackMe, we may have already crossed paths.

## Background

- **Computer Engineer** by training. The hardware-to-software full stack.
- **10+ years in software engineering** before pivoting to security
- **SANS GIAC GSLC** certified
- **CISSP** (in progress, May 2026)

## Let's Talk

I'm always up for conversations about security engineering, AI in security, or interesting problems that need building.
