# Hey, I'm Karlo.

Most people online know me as **AccidentalRebel**. I lead L2 security operations for a 24/7 SOC and head a content engineering squad at [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com), where we build hands-on security training used by 3M+ people worldwide.

Before cybersecurity, I spent 10+ years building software — games, web apps, dev tools. That engineering background shapes how I approach detection engineering, malware analysis, and working with Microsoft Sentinel day to day.

## What I Write About

This blog is where I think out loud. I write about the things I'm actively working on or learning:

- AI applications in security
- Developer tools and workflows
- Malware analysis and reverse engineering
- Detection engineering and threat hunting
- x64 Assembly and low-level programming
- Security tool development
- CTF writeups

I also write training content professionally at TryHackMe, so if you've taken a room there, we may have already crossed paths.
