In [my last blog post](string-av-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-1), I discussed a way to hide parameter strings from being detected by an anti-virus. The solution was simple and it worked. However, it was incomplete as strings of function calls and loaded DLLs were still detectable in memory.

In this post I'll be talking about the other technique from the same [blog post](https://blog.scrt.ch/2020/07/15/engineering-antivirus-evasion-part-ii/) we were following before. It does a good job of explaining the concept which I'll be covering here too. I will also be writing the code in assembly as an added bonus, so we can better understand what goes on under the hood.

## The problem

Let's revisit our code from the last time. We have two functions being called `ShellExecuteA` and `ExitProcess`.

```c
#include <windows.h>
#include <shellapi.h>

int main(void)
{
	char ca_notepad[] = { 'n','o','t','e','p','a','d',0 };
	ShellExecuteA(0, "open", ca_notepad, NULL, NULL, SW_SHOW);

	ExitProcess(0);
}
```

Upon compiling the program, the compiler takes the list of all functions used and places them in the executable (In this case, in the `.rdata` segment) as a readable string:

![string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-2-07]({attach}/images/string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-2-07.png)

A function name like `ShellExecuteA` will be sure to raise some eyebrows so we do not want it to be detectable. To hide this we need to do load the DLL at runtime by using `LoadLibrary` and `GetProcAddress`.

## Coding in C

`LoadLibrary` accepts a string containing the DLL that we want to load.

```c
	HANDLE hShell32 = LoadLibrary("shell32.dll");
```

This loads the DLL's code into memory and returns a handle to that location. We can see the result of this when we look at the memory map in a debugger. Here's the memory map prior to calling `LoadLibrary`:

![string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-2-03]({attach}/images/string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-2-03.png)

And here's what it looks like after:

![string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-2-04]({attach}/images/string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-2-04.png)

The `LoadLibrary` API loaded `shell32.dll` along with it's dependencies into memory. We can also see that it automatically handled where the new DLLs will be placed. In this case, in between pre-existing ones.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Aside: How do we know which DLL is needed?
> We can find out which DLL is needed by a function by looking at it's [MSDN documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibrarya). Scroll at the end of every function documentation to see the "Requirements" section that lists the DLL that it needs.

![string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-2-02]({attach}/images/string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-2-02.png)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`LoadLibrary` then returns a `HANDLE` object which we can then pass to `GetProcAddress`.

```c
	_ShellExecuteA fShellExecuteA = (_ShellExecuteA) GetProcAddress(hShell32, "ShellExecuteA");
```

`GetProcAddress` looks through the library we loaded and returns the address of the `ShellExecuteA` function. This address needs to be cast to a typedef first before it can be called. This means we need to know the structure of the typedef, which we can determine by looking at the "Syntax" section in MSDN.

Here's the syntax for `ShellExecuteA` according to [its documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/shellapi/nf-shellapi-shellexecutea):

```c
HINSTANCE ShellExecuteA(
  [in, optional] HWND   hwnd,
  [in, optional] LPCSTR lpOperation,
  [in]           LPCSTR lpFile,
  [in, optional] LPCSTR lpParameters,
  [in, optional] LPCSTR lpDirectory,
  [in]           INT    nShowCmd
);
```

And here's our typedef implementation:

```c
typedef HINSTANCE (*_ShellExecuteA) (
	HWND   hwnd,
	LPCSTR lpOperation,
	LPCSTR lpFile,
    LPCSTR lpParameters,
	LPCSTR lpDirectory,
	INT    nShowCmd
);
```

When everything is setup properly, the variable `fShellExecuteA` can now be used as a function.

```c
 	fShellExecuteA(0, "open", ca_notepad, NULL, NULL, SW_SHOW);
```

Combining these together, this is what our code will look like:

```c
#include <windows.h>

typedef HINSTANCE (*_ShellExecuteA) (
	HWND   hwnd,
	LPCSTR lpOperation,
	LPCSTR lpFile,
    LPCSTR lpParameters,
	LPCSTR lpDirectory,
	INT    nShowCmd
);

int main(void)
{
	HANDLE hShell32 = LoadLibrary("shell32.dll");
	_ShellExecuteA fShellExecuteA = (_ShellExecuteA) GetProcAddress(hShell32, "ShellExecuteA");

	char ca_notepad[] = { 'n','o','t','e','p','a','d',0 };
 	fShellExecuteA(0, "open", ca_notepad, NULL, NULL, SW_SHOW);

	ExitProcess(0);
}
```

This is not yet done, however, as `strings.exe` can still detect our strings. This is because we now have strings "shell32.dll" and "ShellExecuteA" as parameters for `LoadLibrary` and `GetProcAddress`. And these are placed in the `.data` segment in memory.

![string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-2-05]({attach}/images/string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-2-05.png)

This is where we can use the technique that we used in [part 1](string-av-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-1). By declaring the string as an array as a local variable, the data is placed on the stack instead of in the `.data` segment. 

Applying this technique gives us the following:

```c
	char ca_shell32[] = { 's','h','e','l','l','3','2','.','d','l','l', 0 };
	HANDLE hShell32 = LoadLibrary(ca_shell32);

	char ca_shellExA[] = { 'S','h','e','l','l','E','x','e','c','u','t','e','A', 0 };
	_ShellExecuteA fShellExecuteA = (_ShellExecuteA) GetProcAddress(hShell32, ca_shellExA);
```

And now we can see that it works!

## Converting to assembly

As promised, we'll be converting the code above into x64 windows assembly. It's an extra step, but can give us a better understanding by approaching it from a different programming language.

Starting from the beginning, we'll be using `LoadLibraryA` and `GetProcAddress` to dynamically load the `ShellExecuteA` function at runtime. 

If we fast forward a bit, here's what we'll end up with:

```asm
	lea	rcx, [str_shell32]     ; Load "shell32.dll" string
	sub	rsp, 32
	call	LoadLibraryA       ; Call "LoadLibraryA"
	add	rsp, 32

	mov rcx, rax               ; Save result of LoadLibraryA to rcx
	lea	rdx, [str_shexa]       ; Load "ShellExecuteA" string
	sub	rsp, 32
	call	GetProcAddress     ; Call "GetProcAddress"
	add	rsp, 32
	
	mov rbx, rax               ; The address of "ShellExecuteA" is saved to rbx
	...                        
	... 
	call	rbx	               ; Call "ShellExeecuteA"
```

Wait, that's it? Yes! 

This is the one of those rare moments that the Assembly code is more straightforward than C. This is because the value returned by `GetProcAddresss` is already an address. Since assembly deals with memory addresses, there's no need for any conversion like we did in the C version. The address can be called directly.

And just like the previous one, the code above is still not complete. The "shell" strings are still visible via `strings.exe` so we need to apply the technique again from Part 1. I won't be showing it step by step here anymore as it's quite lengthy.

This means that this example piece of code:

```asm
	lea	rcx, [str_shell32]     ; Load "shell32.dll" string
	sub	rsp, 32
	call	LoadLibraryA       ; Call "LoadLibraryA"
	add	rsp, 32
```

Will now be like this:

```asm
	sub	rsp, 16          ; Place "shell32.dll" string to the stack
	addstr2stack "s", "h", "e", "l", "l", "3", "2", ".", "d", "l", "l", 0x0 
	lea	rcx, [rsp]

	sub	rsp, 32
	call	LoadLibraryA ; Call "LoadLibraryA"
	add	rsp, 32
```

`addstr2stack` is a macro we've written before [in part 1](string-av-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-1). It makes declaring an string array easier.

Combining everything again, here's the final assembly code with comments:

```asm
	push    rbp
	mov     rbp, rsp
 	sub	rsp, 32
	
	;; = START LOADLIBRARY ===========================================
	
	sub	rsp, 16         ; Place "shell32.dll" string to the stack
	addstr2stack "s", "h", "e", "l", "l", "3", "2", ".", "d", "l", "l", 0x0 
	lea	rcx, [rsp]

	sub	rsp, 32
	call	LoadLibraryA ; Call LoadLibraryA
	add	rsp, 32

	add	rsp, 16		    ; Release "shell32.dll" string from stack
	
	;; = END LOADLIBRARY ===========================================
	
	
	;; = START GETPROCADDRESS ===========================================
	
	mov	rcx, rax        ; Save value to rcx (1st parameter register)

	sub	rsp, 16         ; Place "ShellExecuteA" string to the stack
	addstr2stack "S", "h", "e", "l", "l", "E", "x", "e", "c", "u", "t", "e", "A", 0x0
	lea	rdx, [rsp]

 	sub	rsp, 32
	call	GetProcAddress	; Call GetProcAddress
	add	rsp, 32

	add	rsp, 16  	    ; Release "ShellExecuteA" from stack
	
	;; = END GETPROCADDRESS ===========================================
	
	
	;; = START SHELLEXECUTEA ===========================================
	
	mov	r12, rax	    ; Save address of "ShellExecuteA" to r12 (To be called later)

	sub	rsp, 16         ; Place "notepad" string to the stack
	addstr2stack "n", "o", "t", "e", "p", "a", "d", 0x0
	lea	r8, [rsp]

	push	0x5
	push	0x0
	xor	r9, r9

	lea	rdx, [msg_open]	
	xor	rcx, rcx

	sub	rsp, 32
	call	r12         ; Call "ShellExecuteA", jump to addres
	add	rsp, 32

	add	rsp, 16         ; Release "notepad" string from stack
	
	;; = END SHELLEXECUTEA ===========================================

	xor     rax, rax
	call    ExitProcess
```

I know there's a lot to digest with the code above. I've made the flow similar to the flow of the C program so you can review them side by side if you feel lost. Hopefully, the comments and the separators would also help.

> **Note:** Pay special attention to how the stack is reserved (with `sub rsp, 16`) and released (with `add rsp, 16`). I did not discuss stack alignments as it's a lengthy explanation in itself. But just remember that we are releasing the data once we've finished passing it to the function.

If done correctly, the strings would not be detectable because the data is now on the stack and not in the `.data` segment.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It is important to note that anti-viruses can employ different techniques to do detection, but a huge part of their functionality will rely on detecting malicious strings. So at least, on that front, we now have an idea on how to defeat it.

You can view the code for part 1 and 2 [on Github](https://github.com/accidentalrebel/string-anti-virus-evasion-x64-assembly). Updates and fixes will be placed there.

I might post more assembly shenanigans in the future, so stay tuned.
