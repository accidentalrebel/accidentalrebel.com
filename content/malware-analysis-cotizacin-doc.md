Most of the malware I've opened up and analyzed so far are from different challenges and exercises found all over the net. I figured that I've already learned enough that I am ready to try and download a sample from "the wild" and see what information I could get from it.

So I went to any.run, filtered the public submissions to only show ".doc" files, and downloaded the one that seems interesting.

The malware I chose had the name "cotizacin.doc". I immediately sent it to my malware analysis lab and opened it up.
