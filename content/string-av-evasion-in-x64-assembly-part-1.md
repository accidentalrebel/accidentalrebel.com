One of the features I implemented for my [Remote Access Tool](https://github.com/accidentalrebel/RATwurst) was an anti-virus evasion capability in the form of strings obfuscation. It wouldn't fool an EDR or a reverse engineer but it was quick to implement so I added it. 

This was over a year ago. I decided to revisit this feature to try and understand it better and find out if it is actually effective.

## What to expect

In this two-part blog post I will look into the following:

* Hiding argument strings
* Hiding API call strings

THe one you reading now is about the first one. I will be explaining how it's done in C and later convert it to x64 Windows Assembly so we can better understand what's happening under the hood.

## Hiding function argument strings

I got the idea for this AV evasion technique from [this blog post](https://blog.scrt.ch/2020/06/19/engineering-antivirus-evasion/). The author posits that one part of an anti-virus detection capability is through checking for suspicious strings in an executable.

For the purpose of this post, let's pretend that "notepad" is a suspicious string that we don't want be detected by the anti-virus.

```c
#include <windows.h>
#include <shellapi.h>

int main(void)
{
	ShellExecute(0, "open", "notepad", NULL, NULL, SW_SHOW);
}
```

> You might think that a call to `ShellExecute` is already a big red flag, and you are right. It is! But we'll talk about hiding API calls on the next post. Let's focus on the parameter for now.

In the place of the anti-virus, we'll be using the `strings` command to check for visible strings like so:

![string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-1-01]({attach}/images/string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-1-01.png)

As expected, the word "notepad" is easily detected. This is becaues any string that we declare and initialize in a program gets placed in the `.data` segment in memory by the compiler:

![string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-1-02]({attach}/images/string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-1-02.png)

To prevent detection, we need a way for the string to not be present in our compiled executable.

## The solution

The solution is to declare the string to be passed as the parameter like so:

```c
	char ca_notepad[] = { 'n','o','t','e','p','a','d', 0 };
	ShellExecute(0, "open", ca_notepad, NULL, NULL, SW_SHOW);
```

And when `strings` is run, we now see that the "notepad" string is not present anymore.

![string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-1-03]({attach}/images/string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-1-03.png)

How did this happen?

This is because data contained in arrays are placed on the stack instead of the `.data` segment when declared within a function (And also, as long as it is not declared as static).

To further understand how this happens, let's convert this C program into x64 assembly.

## Converting to x64 assembly

First, we setup our boilerplate code with an entry point and a call to `ExitProcess`.

```asm

	bits 64
	default rel

segment .text
	global main
	extern ExitProcess

main:
	push    rbp
	mov     rbp, rsp
	
	xor     rax, rax
	call    ExitProcess
```

Before we can call `ShellExecute`, we first need to import the `ShellExecuteA` symbol using `extern`.

```asm
segment .text
	...
	extern ExitProcess
	extern ShellExecuteA

```
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Aside: Why ShellExecuteA and not ShellExecute?
> Because if you would look in the [MSDN documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/shellapi/nf-shellapi-shellexecutea), you would find that there really isn't a `ShellExecute` function available. There are `ShellExecuteA` (For ANSI strings) and `ShellExecuteW` (For Unicode strings), however. `ShellExecute` is just a macro for these two functions. We can confirm this by looking at the `shellapi.h` source code.

```c
#ifdef UNICODE
#define ShellExecute  ShellExecuteW
#else
#define ShellExecute  ShellExecuteA
#endif // !UNICODE

```

> Since assembly does not use header files we can just call `ShellExecuteA` or `ShellExecuteW` directly. In this example, we won't be needing unicode support so we're going to be using the former.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before we call the function in assembly, let's go back and take a look at how we did it in C.

```c
ShellExecute(0, "open", "notepad", NULL, NULL, SW_SHOW);
```

We have 5 paremeters to pass to the function. Here's how we can write this in assembly using the Microsoft [x64 calling conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/x64-calling-convention?view=msvc-170).

```asm
	push	0x5              ; nShowCmd ; SW_SHOW == 0x5
	push	0x0              ; lpDirectory ; NULL == 0x0
	xor	r9, r9               ; lpParameters ; Clear register == NULL

	lea	r8, [msg_notepad]    ; lpFile
	lea	rdx, [msg_open]	     ; lpOperation
	
	xor	rcx, rcx	         ; hwnd

	sub	rsp, 32
	call	ShellExecuteA    ; Call function
	add	rsp, 32
```

We then initialize the strings by adding a data segment section:

```asm
segment .data
	msg_open	db	"open", 0
	msg_notepad db  "notepad", 0
```

For reference, here is our full code so far:

```asm
	bits 64
	default rel

segment .data
	msg_open	db	"open", 0
	msg_notepad	db	"notepad", 0

segment .text
	global main
	extern ExitProcess
	extern ShellExecuteA

main:
	push    rbp
	mov     rbp, rsp
	
	push	0x5
	push	0x0
	xor	r9, r9

	lea	r8, [msg_notepad]
	lea	rdx, [msg_open]	
	xor	rcx, rcx	

	sub	rsp, 32
	call	ShellExecuteA
	add	rsp, 32

	xor     rax, rax
	call    ExitProcess
```

Take note that this version of the code is still the one where the "notepad" string is detectable.

To hide this string we need to apply the same solution we did to our C code; which is to place the data on the stack so that it would not be placed in the `.data` segment.

Here is how we did it in C:

```c
	char ca_notepad[] = { 'n','o','t','e','p','a','d', 0 };
	ShellExecute(0, "open", ca_notepad, NULL, NULL, SW_SHOW);
```

And here is how to do it in assembly:

```asm
	sub	rsp, 8             ; Reserve space on stack for string
	mov	byte [rsp], "n"
	mov	byte [rsp+1], "o"
	mov	byte [rsp+2], "t"
	mov	byte [rsp+3], "e"
	mov	byte [rsp+4], "p"
	mov	byte [rsp+5], "a"
	mov	byte [rsp+6], "d"
	mov	byte [rsp+7], 0x0	
	lea	r8, [rsp]          ; Load address of string to r8
	add	rsp, 8             ; Reclaim space
	
```

Here's a summary of the the above code:

* Since our string is 8 characters long (Including the `0x0` or `NULL` terminator), we reserve space on the stack with `sub rsp, 8`. 
* Each character is then placed individually in the reserved space using `move byte` while adding an offset to `rsp`.
* The address pointed to by `rsp` is then loaded to the `r8` register (This holds our 3nd parameter).
* We reclaim our reserved space using `add rsp, 8`.

After the code above, `r8` would now point to the location in the stack where our string resides:

![string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-1-04]({attach}/images/string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-1-04.png)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Aside: What if we have longer strings?
> If we have a longer string like "powershell", then we need to reserve more space on the stack.
> Take note, however that when reserving space we need to maintain the *stack alignment* so we add and subtract by multiples of 8.
> The "powershell" string has 11 characters so we use 16.
 
```asm
	sub	rsp, 16
	mov	byte [rsp], "p"
	mov	byte [rsp+1], "o"
	mov	byte [rsp+2], "w"
	mov	byte [rsp+3], "e"
	mov	byte [rsp+4], "r"
	mov	byte [rsp+5], "s"
	mov	byte [rsp+6], "h"
	mov	byte [rsp+7], "e"
	mov	byte [rsp+8], "l"
	mov	byte [rsp+9], "l"
	mov	byte [rsp+10], 0x0
	
	lea	r8, [rsp]
	add	rsp, 16
```

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With this final version of the code, "notepad" will not be visible to `strings` anymore.

Here is our final code:

```asm
	bits 64
	default rel

segment .data
	msg_open	db	"open", 0

segment .text
	global main
	extern ExitProcess
	extern ShellExecuteA

main:
	push    rbp
	mov     rbp, rsp
	
	push	0x5
	push	0x0
	xor	r9, r9

	sub	rsp, 8
	mov	byte [rsp], "n"
	mov	byte [rsp+1], "o"
	mov	byte [rsp+2], "t"
	mov	byte [rsp+3], "e"
	mov	byte [rsp+4], "p"
	mov	byte [rsp+5], "a"
	mov	byte [rsp+6], "d"
	mov	byte [rsp+7], 0x0	
	lea	r8, [rsp]
	add	rsp, 8
	
	lea	rdx, [msg_open]	
	xor	rcx, rcx	

	sub	rsp, 32
	call	ShellExecuteA
	add	rsp, 32

	xor     rax, rax
	call    ExitProcess
```

## Hiding at scale

Writing the code above can get a little tedious especially if we want to pass a really long string. Thankfully, we can use a macro like the one I've written below:

```asm
%macro	addstr2stack	1-*
	%assign	i 0
	%assign j 0
	%rep	%0
 		mov	byte [rsp+i+8*j], %1
		%assign	i i+1
		%rotate 1

		%if i >= 8
			%assign j j+1
			%assign i 0
		%endif
	%endrep
%endmacro
```

What the macro does is that it loops through each character and places it into the correct position on the stack.

> **Important note:** When reserving space on the stack, make sure it is in multiples of 16! This is because the stack has a 16-bit boundary for stack alignment! 

> For example, if our string has 10 characters, we only need to reserve 16 bytes. If our character is 20 characters long, we'd have to reserve 32 bytes.

This macro can then be called like this:

```asm
	sub	rsp, 16        ; Reserve space for the string on the stack
	addstr2stack "n", "o", "t", "e", "p", "a", "d", 0x0
	lea	r8, [rsp]
	...
	add	rsp, 16        ; After use, release the space
```

Here is what the result of the macro looks like in the debugger:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So there you have it, we were able to successfully hide strings by changing the way how the data is declared and placed in memory. If you think about it, the technique is very simple.

However, we've only seen it used against the `strings` command. Can it evade an actual anti-virus? The answer is probably no. In my next post I'll be talking about API call obfuscation that would help hide functions like `ShellExecute`.
