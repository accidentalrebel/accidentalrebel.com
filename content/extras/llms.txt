> Personal blog by Karlo Licudine (AccidentalRebel), a security engineer who builds tools and writes about where AI and cybersecurity collide. L2 SOC lead and content engineering lead at TryHackMe, building hands-on security training for 3M+ users.

## About the Author

Karlo sits at the intersection of security operations and AI. He leads L2 security operations for a 24/7 SOC, builds security tools (ML-based malware classification, shellcode analysis, AI agent containment), and writes about the practical side of both fields. 10+ years in software engineering before pivoting to security. Computer Engineer by training.

## Key Topics

- Detection engineering and SOC operations
- AI agents and security (risks, containment, trust)
- Malware analysis and reverse engineering
- Security tool development
- Security training and education design
