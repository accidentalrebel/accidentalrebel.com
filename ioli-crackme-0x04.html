<h1 id="getting-the-password">Getting the password</h1>
<p>Loading the program in IDA revealed something new. There is now a <code>_check</code> function that when opened looks more complicated than the previous challenges.</p>
<p><img alt="ioli-crackme-0x04-01" src="./images/ioli-crackme-0x04-01.png" /></p>
<p>The one thing that I immediately noticed is the call to the <code>_strlen</code> function similar to the previous challenge. This means that the length of the input string plays another important role.</p>
<p>One curious thing is the condition that leads to the "Password Incorrect" block, as shown below.</p>
<p><img alt="ioli-crackme-0x04-02" src="./images/ioli-crackme-0x04-02.png" /></p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nf">call</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">_strlen</span>
<span class="nf">cmp</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="no">ebp</span><span class="err">+</span><span class="no">var_C</span><span class="p">],</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">eax</span>
<span class="nf">jnb</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">short</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">loc_401387</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>From the looks of it, the check will fail if <code>var_C</code> (Which is our <code>var_counter</code> from the previous challenge) reaches the length of the entered string. If you think about it, this means that it doesn't matter how long the string that the user inputs. What's important is the content.</p>
<p>To find out what the correct content the program expects, we need to look at the other block of code.</p>
<p><img alt="ioli-crackme-0x04-03" src="./images/ioli-crackme-0x04-03.png" /></p>
<p>The code uses the same approach as the previous challenge where <code>var_counter</code> is used to loop through individual characters in the input string.</p>
<p>The part that is new is the use of the <code>_sscanf</code> function which is defined as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"sscanf reads data from s and stores them according to parameter format into the locations given by the additional arguments, as if scanf was used, but reading from s instead of the standard input (stdin)."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking at how the function <code>_sscanf</code> is used, it gets each character in the input string and converts them to decimal integers. This means that the password can only contain the numbers <em>0 through 9</em>. The reason for this is because the result is added to another value at the line <code>add [eax], edx</code>.</p>
<p>This <em>"other value"</em> is the converted integer value from previous loops. This means that the algorithm adds each number from the input string after every loop. For example, an input string of <code>123</code> translates to <code>1+2+3</code> where the computed sum is saved to <code>var_8</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the line <code>cmp [ebp+var_8], 0Fh</code>, which tells us that the program expects the computed sum to be equal to <code>0Fh</code> or <code>15</code>. So as long as we enter numbers that would equal to <code>15</code> when combined, then we are good.</p>

<h1 id="patching-the-executables">Patching the executables</h1>
<p>Patching the executable is different this time around. If on previous challenges we patched the program by changing an conditional opcode to a jmp (<code>74</code> to <code>EB</code>), for this one we only need to change the conditional to a <code>no op</code> instruction (<code>00</code>).</p>
<p><img alt="ioli-crackme-0x04-05" src="./images/ioli-crackme-0x04-05.png" /></p>
<p>As you can see, the line <code>cmp [ebp+var_8]</code> and the conditional branch disappears allowing us to go directly to the <em>"Password OK"</em> part of the code.</p>
<p><img alt="ioli-crackme-0x04-06" src="./images/ioli-crackme-0x04-06.png" /></p>
<h1 id="on-to-the-next-challenge">On to the next challenge...</h1>
<p>I liked this challenge mostly because it changed the passwords the program expects. The first time I tackled this challenge I used purely static analysis. I thought I got the answer only to realize that I was wrong by debugging the code. We have 5 more challenges to go!</p>
