                    <p>I've been using Claude Code for a while now, and I noticed a pattern: at the end of a productive session, I'd have this vague sense of "we figured out some useful stuff" but no concrete record of what those lessons actually were.</p>
<p>Recently, I learned of a skill called <a href="https://github.com/affaan-m/everything-claude-code/tree/main/skills/continuous-learning">continuous-learning</a>. It automatically extracts reusable patterns and saves them as skills. But I wanted something different. Not automated pattern extraction, but a human-readable summary I could actually share. Something I could look back on, or turn into a blog post.</p>
<p>So I built the <a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel/claude-skill-session-retrospective">session-retrospective</a> skill.</p>
<h2 id="what-it-does">What it does</h2>
<p>The skill analyzes the current Claude session and generates a markdown summary covering:
- What we set out to do
- Problems encountered and how they were solved
- Mistakes made and corrections
- Techniques discovered worth remembering
- Key takeaways</p>
<p>The output goes straight to console for copy/paste. No files created, no cleanup needed …</p>

                    <p>I built a Docker wrapper for Claude Code and OpenAI Codex. The main reason is simple: I don't trust AI agents running loose on my machine.</p>
<p>Being in Cyber Security, I've developed a healthy paranoia about software that can execute arbitrary commands. AI coding assistants are powerful, but they're also unpredictable. They can run shell commands, modify files, and access the network. I wanted all of that contained.</p>

<p>Claudecker is my personal tool that wraps Docker to run Claude Code CLI and Codex CLI in an isolated container. Point it at any project directory and it mounts that directory into the container. The AI can do whatever it wants inside the container, but it can't touch the rest of my system.</p>

<ul>
<li>Packed malware machine learning classifier can only previously identify 10 packers</li>
<li>Solution was a customized version of model ensembling, which is to train multiple models and resolve their results</li>
<li>It works with a slight caveat of more extended training and processing, which I could happily live with</li>
</ul>
<p>I recently presented <a href="https://packers.vgl4nt.com/">VGL4NT</a>, my tool that uses machine learning to classify packed malware, at the Blackhat Middle East and Africa meetup. During my talk, I candidly shared one of the tool's limitations which is it can only identify 10 packers because of my hardware constraints. If I want it to be able to identify more, I need to get more GPU (which will be costly) or keep my money and come up with a clever solution. Well, this post is about the latter.</p>

The idea behind this technique (MBC Technique ID: <a href="https://github.com/MBCProject/mbc-markdown/blob/master/anti-behavioral-analysis/virtual-machine-detection.md">B0009.014</a>) is that any value that is lower than 4GB <em>may</em> probably be a sandbox (to reduce costs). This information can then be used with other sandbox evasion techniques to confirm.</p>
<p>For part 2 of this series, I'll be talking about an alternative Windows API function called <code>GlobalMemoryStatusEx</code>. This function is as straightforward as the first one, but requires the passing of a pointer to a C struct. This is significant because I'll be converting a working C code to x64 assembly so we can fully understand how it works under the hood.</p>

<p>MBC is a framework made by Mitre, similar to ATT&amp;CK, but focuses on malware. It lists down the common objectives and behaviors commonly seen in malware.

<p>Question 1. The Threat Hunting process usually starts with the analyst making a hypothesis about a possible compromise vector or techniques used by an attacker. In this scenario, your initial hypothesis is as follows: "The attacker used the WMI subscription mechanism to obtain persistence within the infrastructure". Verify this hypothesis and find the name of the WMI Event Consumer used by the attacker to maintain his foothold.</p>

<p>The very first thing that I do when confronted with a malicious document is to run it in a malware lab. This particular document, however, would not exhibit anything malicious on recent versions of Word.</p>
<p>A quick search of the hash on malware sandboxes would reveal that the document makes use of the <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-18822">CVE-2017-18822 vulnerability</a>. This is a vulnerability that became known and was promptly patched around November of 2017.</p>
<p>The above details give us a hint on how to trigger the document, which is to run the maldoc on a version of Microsoft Word that doesn't have the patches that fix the vulnerability. The easiest way to do this is to boot up a new VM with a fresh install of Windows 7 and with updates disabled.</p>

                    <p>Last April 21, people were posting warnings about a suspicious Facebook post where your account will supposedly get hacked when you click it. From the discussions, I gathered that it is a classic phishing site scam. A very effective one too, because as soon as an account gets compromised the attacker logs in and tags the friends in the account allowing it to spread further. The news of this got big that even the PH CERT issued <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Ncertgovph/posts/1879686332199270">a security advisory on it</a>.</p>

The challenge I made is called <a href="https://cyberdefenders.org/labs/56">Emprisa Maldoc</a> and it is now up on their website. </p>
<p>Emprisa is based on a malicious document that I downloaded blindly from a malware sandbox. It used a relatively old but still interesting exploit that is still in use today. After researching more about it I came across a tool that can generate a malicious doc using the same exact exploit. This is when I got the idea to turn it into a challenge.</p>
<p><img alt="the-emprisa-maldoc-challenge-01" src="./images/the-emprisa-maldoc-challenge-01.png" /></p>
<p>The challenge has 14 questions with increasing and varying difficulty. The challenge is targeted towards intermediate analysts who already have experience examining maldocs before. The goal is to reinforce the use of common malware analysis tools, but at the same time, teach players new things and techniques. It involves flexing muscles related to open …</p>

<p>After the first two challenges I kinda know what to expect already so I skipped running the program and immediately loaded it in IDA.</p>

<p>So the lines leading to the comparison command now looks more complicated than before. We could easily see that there are some computations that happens thanks to the presence of <code>add</code> and <code>imul</code>. Before those, we have two values (<code>5Ah</code> and <code>1ECh</code>) which we can easily guess are the values that will be worked on by these arithmetic functions.</p>
<p>So going through the lines sequentially we can see that the two numbers are first added with <code>add [eax], edx</code>. Which …</p>

<p>I've been playing around with <a href="https://remnux.org/">Remnux</a> and encountered a problem trying to get one of the tools to run properly. The tool is <a href="https://github.com/repnz/shellcode2exe">shellcode2exe</a>, it is used to compile binary shellcode to a file so it can easily be debugged by a debugger.</p>
<p>When I checked out the code, I was surprised to find out how simple it is. Basically, what happens is that the inputted shellcode is added to a barebones assembly file using the <code>incbin</code> assembly instruction. From there, the file is then automatically compiled and linked.</p>
<p>One big problem with the tool is that it needs to use <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a> if it needs to run on Linux. I don't want such a huge dependency especially for my own malware analysis lab so I decided to write my own version which have led to the creation of <code>shcode2exe</code>.</p>

<h1 id="getting-the-password">Getting the password</h1>
<p>Of course, the first thing we do is run the program.</p>
<p><img alt="ioli-crackme-0x01-01" src="./images/ioli-crackme-0x01-01.png" /></p>
<p>Just like last time, we opened up the program in IDA and focused on the part of the code that does the comparing of passwords.</p>
<p><img alt="ioli-crackme-0x01-02" src="./images/ioli-crackme-0x01-02.png" /></p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nf">cmp</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="no">ebp</span><span class="err">+</span><span class="no">var_4</span><span class="p">],</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">149</span><span class="no">Ah</span>
<span class="nf">jz</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">short</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">loc_40137c</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This seems easy enough. </p>
<p>Initially I entered <code>149A</code> as the password but this turned out to be incorrect. The reason for this is because <code>scanf</code> was passed a format of <em>"%d"</em>.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nf">mov</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="no">esp</span><span class="err">+</span><span class="mi">18</span><span class="no">h</span><span class="err">+</span><span class="no">Format</span><span class="p">],</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">offset</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">aD</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="c1">; &quot;%d&quot;</span>
<span class="nf">call</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">_scanf</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This means that the input it expects is actually a decimal integer. So converting <code>149A</code> to decimal results in <code>5274 …</code></p>

                    <p>I joined the <a href="https://ctf.threatsims.com">Defcon Red Team Village CTF</a> because I was curious about it and I wanted to test out the skills that I have gained playing with CTF sites like <a href="https://overthewire.org/wargames/">overthewire.org</a> and <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/">vulnhub</a>. I knew that the challenges won't be easy, but thankfully, I was able to join up with other newbies who were willing to give it a go and learn with each other.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I fell asleep just before the CTF started and when I woke up all the easy challenges were already solved by my team members. There was one easy challenge that was still open on the CovidScammers category, so I quickly got started to solving that.</p>

<p>Any network capable device has a unique factory-assigned Media Access Control (MAC) address. Users have no way to change the MAC address but it can be done. However, it is possible to mask the MAC address and have it show a different value. This is called MAC spoofing.</p>
<p>There are legitimate uses for MAC spoofing. For example, there may be certain applications that require a particular MAC address to work, or maybe your ISP expects a certain MAC address to connect to the network. MAC spoofing is largely used for illegitimate uses, like circumventing an access control list or getting past a filter on a wireless network.</p>

<p>When I started my project, I initially intended for it to use just pure C, as this is the one I'm more familiar with. But over time some C++ features crept in. Features like namespacess, bools, and function overloading proved to be useful so I kept using them. Now my code uses C concepts with new nifty C++ features.</p>
<p>Now, I could have just continued with this approach. It works, after all. But I wondered if I should just stick to C and drop C++ altogether. My thinking is that sticking with just one language would make the code simpler as I only have to use it's subset of features. I know …</p>

<p>I was adding new Lisp functions to <a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel/Rebel-Game-Engine">my game engine</a> when I noticed that I had functions that had a naming scheme that were inconsistent with others. For example, I had ones that create objects like <em>sprite_create</em> and <em>shader_create</em> but this one function I named <em>make_vec3</em>. I proceeded to rename <em>make_vec3</em> to <em>vec3_create</em>. Not only is it consistent with other names but it made me realize that having a pattern of object_verb makes it easy to parse the function and what it does. </p>
<p>This made me wonder if there are other ways I could improve which led me to this page <a href="http://community.schemewiki.org/?variable-naming-convention">about variable naming conventions</a> for Scheme. I learned that the language employs a rather effective yet simple naming convention for functions and variables. I've noticed them before but never really thought about their usefulness. </p>
<p>For example, adding a <em>?</em> prefix easily indicates that the function, when called, will always return …</p>

<p>It might seem silly to be working on this while the engine is still in its early stages, but I think it is better to get this out of the way before the codebase becomes huge. With a small codebase I was able to easily identify the causes of the problems as I was porting them.</p>
<p>It still wasn't a walk in the park, however. Being inexperienced with developing C programs on other platforms (I've only done it mostly in Linux) I had to do research and do a lot of trial and error. I learned so much about cross-compilers, portable makefiles, and the quirks of different …</p>

The community was helpful in answering my questions as I tried to track down the cause of the bug, but I eventually gave up out of frustration.</p>
<p>I then learned about <a href="http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/5/bind">Chicken Scheme</a>, a somewhat competitor to Chibi that does the same thing but with a larger community and more documentation. I checked it out and liked it so I went ahead and implemented it.</p>

<p>I like Lisp. I use it a lot when customizing my Emacs environment (<a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel?tab=repositories&amp;q=&amp;type=&amp;language=emacs+lisp">using ELisp</a>). There's something about it's syntax and different way to structure programs that appeals to my programmer brain.

                    <p>Our latest game, HistoHunters, has grown into a really big project that compilation now takes a really long time. Longer than no sane programmer wants it to be. It has gotten so bad that changing a single file would take about a minute for recompilation! </p>
<p>Thankfully, I have managed to shorten this wait time through the use of <a href="https://coffeebraingames.wordpress.com/2018/01/21/reducing-compile-time-in-unity-using-assembly-definition-files/">assembly definitions</a>. If you have a big Unity project and compile times are slow, this is the solution to that. Just for kicks I also purchased an SSD and that also helped reduce compile times (Not much as the assembly definitions though).</p>
<p>However, in spite of these changes compiling still takes a few seconds to reload scripts. This seems to be the lowest it could go. While this is definitely better, I can't help but feel that the seconds spent waiting is wasted.</p>

<p>I've recently embarked on a mission to fully integrate <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> with my Unity game development environment. One feature that I wanted to have is the ability to open Unity scripts and text-based files in Emacs instead of MonoDevelop. This is an easy task for supported external editors but for those who aren't (Like Emacs), doing something like this is a bit tricky.</p>
<p>Setting <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Invoking-emacsclient.html">emacsclient</a> as the external editor works in opening the files but the line number is not passed at all (Or is not received by emacs. <a href="https://forum.unity.com/threads/external-editor-arguments-issue.350473/">Seems to be a bug</a>). This means that opening files in the Project Window works but you would not be able to to jump to lines that have errors from the Console. This, of course, is unacceptable.</p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We used a risk adjusted estimation system that produces near accurate estimates we can confidently rely on.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>I usually dreaded being asked how long a programming task will take. I always seem to have the knack to overshoot no matter how hard I try. This is an all too common scenario that programmers face and is something that is considered to be a difficult, if not impossible, problem to solve.</p>
<p><img alt="01" src="https://i.imgur.com/KqCZUHl.jpg" /></p>
<p>This all changed when I was introduced to a helpful system that helps in producing estimates that are "accurate enough". I don't think it has a name yet but my colleagues who introduced me to it says that they got it from a <a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/181992/waterfall_game_development_done_.php">Gamasutra article</a> by Eric Preisz of Garage Games. Since then I've used this system …</p>

<ul>
<li>There is more to the saying that "premature optimization is the root of all evil".</li>
<li>Instead of asking WHEN to optimize, it is more important to ask WHAT and HOW to optimize.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>It is a well known adage among programmers that premature optimization is the root of all evil. If this is true then I must have been very close to the devil himself.</p>
<p>During the early months of development on Chef Wars I did my best to optimize my code as much as possible. We were making a big game and I wanted to have a stable foundation to build our game on. I obsessed over lots of things from the interconnection of the various systems to folder structures. I was happy with all that I've built …</p>

<p><strong>TLDR</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All data in our game is contained in one excel file we call the "Universe".</li>
<li>Prototypes can be done on the Universe excel file itself</li>
<li>Iteration is easier as we only need to change one file.</li>
<li>We made a system that downloads changes from our server so players don't need to update their builds.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Before we started development on Chef Wars, Cliff, my co-founder and game designer for the team, already had pages of spreadsheets containing important values in the game. It's kinda like a game design document but in the form of tables, columns, and rows. This "Universe" file contained everything from stats, dialogue, competitions, locations, chefs, and enemies just to name a few. </p>

                    <p>One of the problems I was having with my Emacs environment under WSL <em>(Windows Subsystem for Linux, aka. Bash On Windows)</em> is that I could not copy text from WSL Emacs to other Windows applications. Copy and pasting from Windows to Emacs works without any problems so it's weird it does not work the other way around.</p>
<p>I tried a lot of solutions from Google but none of them seem to work. There was an emacs package called <a href="https://github.com/rolandwalker/simpleclip">simpleclip</a> that worked but the results were not consistent.</p>
<p>I then realized that a temporary solution would be to make use of Windows' clip.exe command line utility which can bme seen below.</p>
