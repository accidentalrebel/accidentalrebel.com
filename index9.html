            <p>I am continuing my reverse engineering review by tackling the <em>IOLI crackmes</em> by <a href="https://twitter.com/pof">@pof</a>. These are beginner friendly challenges that is perfect for newbies or for those who want to review the basics like me. Check out my writeup for 0x00 <a href="./ioli-crackme-0x00.html">here</a>.</p>
<h1 id="getting-the-password">Getting the password</h1>
<p>Of course, the first thing we do is run the program.</p>
<p><img alt="ioli-crackme-0x01-01" src="./images/ioli-crackme-0x01-01.png" /></p>
<p>Just like last time, we opened up the program in IDA and focused on the part of the code that does the comparing of passwords.</p>
<p><img alt="ioli-crackme-0x01-02" src="./images/ioli-crackme-0x01-02.png" /></p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nf">cmp</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="no">ebp</span><span class="err">+</span><span class="no">var_4</span><span class="p">],</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">149</span><span class="no">Ah</span>
<span class="nf">jz</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">short</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">loc_40137c</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This seems easy enough. </p>
<p>Initially I entered <code>149A</code> as the password but this turned out to be incorrect. The reason for this is because <code>scanf</code> was passed a format of <em>"%d"</em>.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nf">mov</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="no">esp</span><span class="err">+</span><span class="mi">18</span><span class="no">h</span><span class="err">+</span><span class="no">Format</span><span class="p">],</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">offset</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">aD</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="c1">; &quot;%d&quot;</span>
<span class="nf">call</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">_scanf</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This means that the input it expects is actually a decimal integer. So converting <code>149A</code> to decimal results in <code>5274</code>, which is the correct password.</p>
<p><img alt="ioli-crackme-0x01-03" src="./images/ioli-crackme-0x01-03.png" /></p>
<h1 id="patching-the-executables">Patching the executables</h1>
<p>Patching the executable is actually the same process as <a href="./ioli-crackme-0x00.html">my writeup for 0x00</a>.</p>
<h1 id="passing-arguments-to-functions">Passing arguments to functions</h1>
<p>Since the crackme was cracked relatively quickly I want to review and highlight how arguments are passed to functions. </p>
<p>The format of the <code>scanf</code> function in C is like so:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kt">int</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">scanf</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">const</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">char</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">format</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">...</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Here's an example of how it is used:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kt">int</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="n">scanf</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s">&quot;%d&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="n">i</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>If we look at the 0x01 program we could see how the arguments are passed to the <em>_scanf</em> function by placing the data to send on top of the stack.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nf">lea</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">eax</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="no">ebp</span><span class="err">+</span><span class="no">var_4</span><span class="p">]</span>
<span class="nf">mov</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="no">esp</span><span class="err">+</span><span class="mi">18</span><span class="no">h</span><span class="err">+</span><span class="no">var_14</span><span class="p">],</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">eax</span>
<span class="nf">mov</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="no">esp</span><span class="err">+</span><span class="mi">18</span><span class="no">h</span><span class="err">+</span><span class="no">Format</span><span class="p">],</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">offset</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">aD</span><span class="c1">;  &quot;%d&quot;</span>
<span class="nf">call</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">_scanf</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>lea eax, [ebp+var_4]</code> gets the address of <em>var_4</em>, this is the memory location where scanf would put the inputted data. This is then added to the stack with <code>mov [esp+18h+var_14]</code>.</p>
<p><code>offset aD</code> gets the address of <code>aD</code> which contains the string <em>"%d"</em>. This is the <em>format</em> parameter that <em>scanf</em> expects. This is then added to the stack with <code>mov [esp+18h+Format]</code>.</p>
<p>With the two parameters added to the stack, it can now be used by the <em>scanf</em> function when <code>call _scanf</code> is executed.</p>
<p>I'm not sure if I was able to explain that properly. At the very least, you should have been able to have a basic idea of how variables are passed to functions. Take note, however, that there are other calling conventions for functions which meants that the passing of arguments can also differ.</p>
<h1 id="on-to-the-next-challenge">On to the next challenge...</h1>
<p>This is the second challenge out of 10 in the IOLI series of challenges. So far the challenges are still very easy, which is fine because it's still good for practice. I look forward to the next one.</p>

        <div class="article-content">
            <p>I am re-familiarizing myself with reverse engineering again by going through some simple crackme challenges. This one is called the IOLI Crackmes by pof. The goal is to find the correct password and also to patch it so that it can accept any input and still show that it's correct.</p>
<h2 id="getting-the-password">Getting the password</h2>
<p>Running the program shows a password prompt. </p>
<p><img alt="ioli-crackme-0x00-03" src="./images/ioli-crackme-0x00-03.png" /></p>
<p>Of course, randomly entering passwords is going to be a waste of time so I opened up IDA to look at its code.</p>
<p>I knew that whatever password I enter in the program would be checked against the actual password. This is the part of the program that I should focus on so I scanned the code and found this:</p>
<p><img alt="ioli-crackme-0x00-02" src="./images/ioli-crackme-0x00-02.png" /></p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nf">mov</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="no">esp</span><span class="err">+</span><span class="mi">38</span><span class="no">h</span><span class="err">+</span><span class="no">Str2</span><span class="p">],</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">offset</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">Str2</span><span class="c1">; &quot;250382&quot;</span>
<span class="nf">mov</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="no">esp</span><span class="err">+</span><span class="mi">38</span><span class="no">h</span><span class="err">+</span><span class="no">Format</span><span class="p">],</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">eax</span><span class="c1">; </span>
<span class="nf">call</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">_strcmp</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>And just from these few lines alone I already knew what the password is. IDA Pro was helpful enough to add a comment that <code>offset Str2</code> equates to <code>250382</code>. Surely enough, this number was the password.</p>
<p><img alt="ioli-crackme-0x00-04" src="./images/ioli-crackme-0x00-04.png" /></p>
<h2 id="patching-the-executable">Patching the executable</h2>
<p>The next part of the challenge is to patch the executable so that it can accept any input and would still allow us through.</p>
<p>Looking at the graph view, we want the program to always go to the node on the right which has the "Password OK" message. </p>
<p><img alt="ioli-crackme-0x00-05" src="./images/ioli-crackme-0x00-05.png" /></p>
<p>The line that we could change to allow us to do this would be this one:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nf">jz</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">short</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">loc_40138A</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The <code>jz</code> can be changed to a <code>jmp</code> command by changing the op code. Opening up the "Patch Bytes" window while the line is highlighted would show us this:</p>
<p><img alt="ioli-crackme-0x00-06" src="./images/ioli-crackme-0x00-06.png" /></p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="mf">74</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">0</span><span class="n">E</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">C7</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">04</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">24</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">2</span><span class="n">E</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">40</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">40</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">00</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">E8</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">A8</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">19</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">00</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">00</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">EB</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mf">0</span><span class="n">C</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The opcode related to <code>jz short loc_40138A</code> is the first two btyes <code>74 0E</code>. <code>74</code> is the "Jump short if equal" opcode and <code>0E</code> is the relative jump distance. Changing <code>74</code> to <code>EB</code> converts it to the "Jump" opcode effectively making the line <code>jmp short loc_40138A</code>.</p>
<p><img alt="ioli-crackme-0x00-07" src="./images/ioli-crackme-0x00-07.png" /></p>
<p>After saving, IDA will automatically upgrade the graph. It will now show us that the flow of the program now jumps to the right node directly.</p>
<p><img alt="ioli-crackme-0x00-08" src="./images/ioli-crackme-0x00-08.png" /></p>
<p>All that is left to do is to patch the executable via "Edit &gt; Patch Program &gt; Apply patches to input file..." and run the program. From here, any entered password would automatically get accepted.</p>
<p><img alt="ioli-crackme-0x00-09" src="./images/ioli-crackme-0x00-09.png" /></p>
<h2 id="on-to-the-next-challenge">On to the next challenge...</h2>
<p>This is the first out of the 10 challenges from this set. Since this is the first one, it is only natural for it to be very easy. It's still a good refresher for me especially since the last time I did any reversing was from a few years ago. I look forward to the next challenges, I do hope that they would ramp up in difficulty and also teach me new things for me to improve.</p>

<p>TLDR: Participated in a blue team CTF, had a lot of fun, looking forward for more</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yesterday I participated in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/guidemtraining">GuideM "Hunt the Kingdom" CTF challenge</a>. It served as the final activity at the end of the <em>"Cyber Defense and Threat Hunting"</em> course.</p>
<p>I was looking forward to this CTF, especially after my awesome experience with the <a href="./covidscammers-writeup--defcon-rtv-ctf.html">Red Team Village CTF at Defcon</a>. This one is centered on the Blue Team side, and I was curious as to how it will play out.</p>
<h2 id="the-preparation">The Preparation</h2>
<p>I took one whole day to study and prepare. I went through all our slides and have written down the important concepts and commands to an org file. This is important because I wanted them to be easily searchable, which helped a lot during the challenge.</p>
<p>I also did research about the Hunt the Kingdom challenge itself. There weren't much information online about it but there were <a href="https://www.facebook.com/guidemtraining/photos/a.142012317191141/229536238438748/">some social media posts</a> that contained screenshots on how the challenge looked like. These gave me a lot of information on what to expect.</p>
<p><img alt="hunt-the-kingdom-ctf-challenge-01" src="./images/hunt-the-kingdom-ctf-challenge-01.jpg" /></p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>It&#39;s OSINT in practice :P
</code></pre></div>

<p>For example, with the screenshot above I learned how the UI looked like, that there were categories that we could switch to, leaderboards, how a question is structured, and that "areas" on the map can get added, enabled, and disabled during the game. The last part is particularly important as it means that not all questions are available from the start and some can get disabled during the game.</p>
<p>Thanks to the above research I felt confident that I could hit the ground running as soon as the game started. I picked my name (AccidentalRebel, of course) and my emblem and I was ready for the hunt.</p>
<p><img alt="hunt-the-kingdom-ctf-challenge-02" src="./images/hunt-the-kingdom-ctf-challenge-02.png" /></p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Yes, that&#39;s the blue tank from Advance Wars, because I&#39;m part of the &quot;blue team&quot;.
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="the-hunt">The Hunt</h2>
<p>When the hunt started my approach was to focus on the easy problems first. Getting them out of the way early would allow me to rack up points and just focus on the hard ones afterwards. This did the trick and I was able to maintain an early lead.</p>
<p>During the mid-game my computer hanged from all the switching between VMs (There were 3 VMs that we needed to use to solve the problems). <em>Note to self: get a beefier PC</em>. I got a bit frustrated by this but decided that instead of waiting for Windows to boot I could use the time to take a break and got lunch. </p>
<p><img alt="hunt-the-kingdom-ctf-challenge-03" src="./images/hunt-the-kingdom-ctf-challenge-03.53" /></p>
<p>I came back to the game all full and refreshed, but sadly, I have already lost my lead. I felt a bit disappointed by this but I continued to push through. I removed the leaderboards to minimize distractions which helped. No need to pressure myself, I told myself. Although, I admit that I did peek from time to time.</p>
<p>With the renewed focus I was able to keep my standing in the top 3. The leader of the pack during the end-game was <em>BoyHack3r</em>, a worthy opponent who was always a few points ahead of me. </p>
<p>There was one question that has a lot of points that only has one solve. I knew that if I could get that it would give me enough points to snatch back 1st place. It wasn't an easy problem though so I changed my approach by slowing down which helped me understand the questions better. A few minutes later I was back at first place.</p>
<p>I've never done a celebratory fist pump before, this was the first time.</p>
<h2 id="the-final-minutes">The Final Minutes</h2>
<p>I was able to maintain first place position by continuously answering questions until I was left with just four questions. These four are problems that no one has solved yet. The activity on the leaderboards have lessened which I took to mean that the others were stuck like me. I was at 13740 points, BoyHack3r at 13590, and Overwatch at 13460. If any of them managed to solve just one out of these four problems then they'll easily overtake me.</p>
<p>I wasn't going to let that happen though. At 5 minutes left I continued solving the one that I had the most progress with. But it wasn't enough and I ran out of time. The others didn't get their lucky break either which finally cemented the scores on the boards.</p>
<p><img alt="hunt-the-kingdom-ctf-challenge-04" src="./images/hunt-the-kingdom-ctf-challenge-04.PNG" /></p>
<p>After 6 hours of back-breaking hunting I was finally able to breathe a sigh of relief. </p>
<h2 id="the-end">The End</h2>
<p>I rarely engage in any competitive activity so my competitive side rarely comes out. This CTF definitely brought it out and gave me the push to take the challenge seriously. I didn't do it for the prizes though. I did it because I wanted to prove to myself that I have what it takes, especially since I don't have a formal background in CyberSecurity. While a CTF is not an accurate qualification of being part of a blue team, it does show a participant's ability to work and solve problems under pressure.</p>
<p>I want to give a shoutout to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/guidemtraining">GuideM</a> for guiding us throughout the course and for the extremely fun CTF challenge. Also to <em>BoyHack3r</em>, <em>Overwatch</em>, and <em>:]</em> for making me sweat bullets.</p>
<p>This is another big step for me into the world of cybersecurity and I do hope I could learn more and improve. I look forward to the next CTF!</p>
