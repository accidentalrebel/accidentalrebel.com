<p>Yesterday I participated in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/guidemtraining">GuideM "Hunt the Kingdom" CTF challenge</a>. It served as the final activity at the end of the <em>"Cyber Defense and Threat Hunting"</em> course.</p>
<p>I was looking forward to this CTF, especially after my awesome experience with the <a href="./covidscammers-writeup--defcon-rtv-ctf.html">Red Team Village CTF at Defcon</a>. This one is centered on the Blue Team side, and I was curious as to how it will play out.</p>
<h2 id="the-preparation">The Preparation</h2>
<p>I took one whole day to study and prepare. I went through all our slides and have written down the important concepts and commands to an org file. This is important because I wanted them to be easily searchable, which helped a lot during the challenge.</p>
<p>I also did research about the Hunt the Kingdom challenge itself. There weren't much information online about it …</p>

            <p>I've done a lot of electronics projects already, all of them were painstakingly hand-soldered on a perfboard. I actually like this approach for quick prototyping, and plus, I've also grown fond of how "raw" it looks like. In spite of this, I've always been curious and interested in having my own printed PCB. I remember designing one for my <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/164144-tiro-vibrating-watch/log/161430-current-state-and-next-steps">TIRO vibrating watch</a> but I never pushed through with it because I wasn't confident with what I've made.</p>

<p>Any network capable device has a unique factory-assigned Media Access Control (MAC) address. Users have no way to change the MAC address but it can be done. However, it is possible to mask the MAC address and have it show a different value. This is called MAC spoofing.</p>
<p>There are legitimate uses for MAC spoofing. For example, there may be certain applications that require a particular MAC address to work, or maybe your ISP expects a certain MAC address to connect to the network. MAC spoofing is largely used for illegitimate uses, like circumventing an access control list or getting past a filter on a wireless network.</p>
<h2 id="changing-mac-address-via-ifconfig">Changing MAC Address via ifconfig</h2>

            <p>After the recent changes to the <a href="./following-lispy-conventions.html">lisp side of my engine</a>, I took some time to review the C/C++ side. You'll notice that I have written C/C++ and that's because my codebase uses both of them. </p>
<p>When I started my project, I initially intended for it to use just pure C, as this is the one I'm more familiar with. But over time some C++ features crept in. Features like namespacess, bools, and function overloading proved to be useful so I kept using them. Now my code uses C concepts with new nifty C++ features.</p>
<p>Now, I could have just continued with this approach. It works, after all. But I wondered if I should just stick to C and drop C++ altogether. My thinking is that sticking with just one language would make the code simpler as I only have to use it's subset of features. I know …</p>

<p>I was adding new Lisp functions to <a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel/Rebel-Game-Engine">my game engine</a> when I noticed that I had functions that had a naming scheme that were inconsistent with others. For example, I had ones that create objects like <em>sprite_create</em> and <em>shader_create</em> but this one function I named <em>make_vec3</em>. I proceeded to rename <em>make_vec3</em> to <em>vec3_create</em>. Not only is it consistent with other names but it made me realize that having a pattern of object_verb makes it easy to parse the function and what it does. </p>
<p>This made me wonder if there are other ways I could improve which led me to this page <a href="http://community.schemewiki.org/?variable-naming-convention">about variable naming conventions</a> for Scheme. I learned that the language employs a rather effective yet simple naming convention for functions and variables. I've noticed them before but never really thought about their usefulness. </p>
<p>For example, adding a <em>?</em> prefix easily indicates that the function, when called, will always return …</p>

<p>It might seem silly to be working on this while the engine is still in its early stages, but I think it is better to get this out of the way before the codebase becomes huge. With a small codebase I was able to easily identify the causes of the problems as I was porting them.</p>
<p>It still wasn't a walk in the park, however. Being inexperienced with developing C programs on other platforms (I've only done it mostly in Linux) I had to do research and do a lot of trial and error. I learned so much about cross-compilers, portable makefiles, and the quirks of different …</p>

            <p>When I first learned about <a href="http://synthcode.com/wiki/chibi-scheme">Chibi</a>, an embeddable scheme that allows scripting on C programs, I immediately tried it out on my game engine. I was able to make it work with my existing APIs but I kept on running against segfaults and memory issues. The community was helpful in answering my questions as I tried to track down the cause of the bug, but I eventually gave up out of frustration.</p>
<p>I then learned about <a href="http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/5/bind">Chicken Scheme</a>, a somewhat competitor to Chibi that does the same thing but with a larger community and more documentation. I checked it out and liked it so I went ahead and implemented it.</p>

<p>Thankfully I have not experienced any segfaults anymore. It's not because Chicken is better (I don't know well enough of the two to make a good comparison) but because I've come to better understand how to properly structure my code …</p>

            <p>I've long wondered if I should add a scripting language to <a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel/Rebel-Game-Engine">my game engine</a>. I know that most game engines could do without such a feature but I just recently came across <a href="https://github.com/ashinn/chibi-scheme">Chibi-Scheme</a>, a library that allows the use of Scheme lisp scripting for C programs. </p>
<p>I like Lisp. I use it a lot when customizing my Emacs environment (<a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel?tab=repositories&amp;q=&amp;type=&amp;language=emacs+lisp">using ELisp</a>). There's something about it's syntax and different way to structure programs that appeals to my programmer brain. I've toyed with other Lisp flavors but never had a strong enough reason to continue using them. With Chibi-scheme I may have found that reason.</p>
<p><img alt="thinking-of-adding-lisp-to-my-custom-game-engine-01" src="./images/thinking-of-adding-lisp-to-my-custom-game-engine-01.jpg" /></p>
<p>I am aware that Lisp is not as widespread as Lua or Javascript. And that choosing it might limit the number of potential people to try out my game engine. But as I've been telling myself over and over, this is a self-learning project. So it's okay …</p>
