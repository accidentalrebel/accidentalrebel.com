                <p>This is part 1 out of 2 of my writeup for the Maldoc101 challenge made by Josh Stroschein (<a href="https://twitter.com/jstrosch">@jstrosch</a>) and is currently playable at <a href="https://cyberdefenders.org/labs/51">Cyberdefenders.Org</a>. I've done some maldoc analysis before but this is the first time I'm writing about my approach.</p>
<p>There is also an already existing writeup about this challenge <a href="https://github.com/jstrosch/malware-samples/blob/master/malware_analysis_exercises/2020/December/solution.md">from the creator himself</a>. You should check that out if you want a more detailed and focused writeup. This writeup is more from the perspective of someone relatively new to malware analysis. There's a lot more exploration and trial-and-error which, I hope, might give the reader a different view in how this kind of problem is approached.</p>

<p>I've been playing around with <a href="https://remnux.org/">Remnux</a> and encountered a problem trying to get one of the tools to run properly. The tool is <a href="https://github.com/repnz/shellcode2exe">shellcode2exe</a>, it is used to compile binary shellcode to a file so it can easily be debugged by a debugger.</p>
<p>When I checked out the code, I was surprised to find out how simple it is. Basically, what happens is that the inputted shellcode is added to a barebones assembly file using the <code>incbin</code> assembly instruction. From there, the file is then automatically compiled and linked.</p>
<p>One big problem with the tool is that it needs to use <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a> if it needs to run on Linux. I don't want such a huge dependency especially for my own malware analysis lab so I decided to write my own version which have led to the creation of <code>shcode2exe</code>.</p>

                <p>I joined the <a href="https://ctf.threatsims.com">Defcon Red Team Village CTF</a> because I was curious about it and I wanted to test out the skills that I have gained playing with CTF sites like <a href="https://overthewire.org/wargames/">overthewire.org</a> and <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/">vulnhub</a>. I knew that the challenges won't be easy, but thankfully, I was able to join up with other newbies who were willing to give it a go and learn with each other.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I fell asleep just before the CTF started and when I woke up all the easy challenges were already solved by my team members. There was one easy challenge that was still open on the CovidScammers category, so I quickly got started to solving that.</p>
