<blockquote>
<p>Question 11. As a result of running a malicious code, which we talk about in questions 9 and 10, the attacker got a shell on the compromised host. Using this access, the attacker downloaded the Active Directory collection utility to the host in an encoded form. Specify a comma-separated, non-spaced link where the encoded version of the utility was downloaded and a SHA256 hash of the decoded version that was directly run by the attacker on the compromised host.</p>

<p>Question 6. Specify the domain name of the resource from which the files mentioned in question 5 were supposedly downloaded as a result of malicious code execution.</p>

<p>This one is easy. Using the same date range from the previous question, I changed the query to <code>event_type:DNSReq</code> (where "DNSReq" is short for "DNS Requests").</p>
<p><img alt="cyber-corp-case-2-writeup-part-2-01" src="../images/cyber-corp-case-2-writeup-part-2-01.png" /></p>

<h2 id="understanding-wmi-persistence">Understanding WMI Persistence</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Question 1. The Threat Hunting process usually starts with the analyst making a hypothesis about a possible compromise vector or techniques used by an attacker. In this scenario, your initial hypothesis is as follows: "The attacker used the WMI subscription mechanism to obtain persistence within the infrastructure". Verify this hypothesis and find the name of the WMI Event Consumer used by the attacker to maintain his foothold.</p>

                <p>Since my last post about <a href="investigating-an-fb-phishing-site">my investigations of a Facebook phishing site</a>, I have received several messages from friends asking me to check out other suspected phishing/scam sites. One of the most alarming out of them was this one where I was able to find the file where the scammer stores the phished usernames and passwords.</p>
<p><img alt="finding-phished-passwords-from-a-scam-site-01" src="../images/finding-phished-passwords-from-a-scam-site-01.png" /></p>
<p>This particular phishing site conducts its operations like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>An ad is shown on Facebook, promising free coupons for famous fast food restaurants</li>
<li>Clicking on the ad takes the user to a fake Facebook login page hosted on <em>blogger.com</em></li>
<li>Login page then sends phished username and passwords to a PHP file hosted on <em>000webhost</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The phished passwords are then stored in a <code>.txt</code> file (blatantly named, <code>victims.txt</code>), which is publicly accessible on an open directory. Getting to this directory involved following the scripts and the URLs used by the scammers. It's …</p>

                <p>Last April 21, people were posting warnings about a suspicious Facebook post where your account will supposedly get hacked when you click it. From the discussions, I gathered that it is a classic phishing site scam. A very effective one too, because as soon as an account gets compromised the attacker logs in and tags the friends in the account allowing it to spread further. The news of this got big that even the PH CERT issued <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Ncertgovph/posts/1879686332199270">a security advisory on it</a>.</p>

<p>I wanted to see the phishing site for myself but I was unlucky and did not get tagged by anyone. So I reached out to people who did and I eventually got to this page shown below:</p>
