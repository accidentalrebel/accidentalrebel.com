            <p>When I first learned about <a href="http://synthcode.com/wiki/chibi-scheme">Chibi</a>, an embeddable scheme that allows scripting on C programs, I immediately tried it out on my game engine. I was able to make it work with my existing APIs but I kept on running against segfaults and memory issues. The community was helpful in answering my questions as I tried to track down the cause of the bug, but I eventually gave up out of frustration.</p>
<p>I then learned about <a href="http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/5/bind">Chicken Scheme</a>, a somewhat competitor to Chibi that does the same thing but with a larger community and more documentation. I checked it out and liked it so I went ahead and implemented it.</p>
<p><img alt="implemented-basic-scheme-scripting-for-rebel-game-engine-01" src="./images/implemented-basic-scheme-scripting-for-rebel-game-engine-01.png" /></p>
<p>Thankfully I have not experienced any segfaults anymore. It's not because Chicken is better (I don't know well enough of the two to make a good comparison) but because I've come to better understand how to properly structure my code after two implementations.</p>
<p>And my code did change a lot. The biggest change is switching from an object oriented approach to functional style so that it would suit Lisp scripting. I also paid special attention in making sure that whatever change I made would make sense when the game engine is used without scripting. My guiding principle is that implementing a game on both C and Scheme should be structurally identical, aside from the difference in syntaxes, of course.</p>

<p>Implementing Lisp, and coding with it has been very fun too. I've had the most fun when <a href="http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/5/bind">I implemented the FFI</a>. Every time I go through the wiki I find a better way of doing things so I'd go and re-implement them again. Each iteration I learn something new and it's such a joy exploring.</p>
<p>Playing with the garbage collector has also made me think about memory management more. This resulted in having two ways to call certain API functions: one will return a pointer that will automatically get tracked by the GC. The other you'd have to free manually. I figured this is a good approach for situations when having control over memory and references is crucial.</p>
<p>I've already spent a lot of time on this project and it was mostly spent on the scripting side of the engine. There are still more to do for it to be considered useful but I'm happy I was able to learn a lot.</p>
<p>If you are curious about the engine you could check it out <a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel/Rebel-Game-Engine">here</a>.</p>

            <p>I've long wondered if I should add a scripting language to <a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel/Rebel-Game-Engine">my game engine</a>. I know that most game engines could do without such a feature but I just recently came across <a href="https://github.com/ashinn/chibi-scheme">Chibi-Scheme</a>, a library that allows the use of Scheme lisp scripting for C programs. </p>
<p>I like Lisp. I use it a lot when customizing my Emacs environment (<a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel?tab=repositories&amp;q=&amp;type=&amp;language=emacs+lisp">using ELisp</a>). There's something about it's syntax and different way to structure programs that appeals to my programmer brain. I've toyed with other Lisp flavors but never had a strong enough reason to continue using them. With Chibi-scheme I may have found that reason.</p>
<p><img alt="thinking-of-adding-lisp-to-my-custom-game-engine-01" src="./images/thinking-of-adding-lisp-to-my-custom-game-engine-01.jpg" /></p>
<p>I am aware that Lisp is not as widespread as Lua or Javascript. And that choosing it might limit the number of potential people to try out my game engine. But as I've been telling myself over and over, this is a self-learning project. So it's okay if no one would try it out as long as I get to learn from it.</p>
<p>This morning I started implementing a simple implementation of Chibi. Thankfully, it's easy to setup. However, the more I implement it the more that I realize that I may need to change how my engine is structured to better suit Lisp's functional nature. This means less object oriented design similar to how <a href="https://www.raylib.com/index.html">Raylib</a> does things. </p>
<p>I still need some time to think this through. I am open to do the changes needed if I am to include a scripting language. I just want to make sure if my engine would really need it. We'll see.</p>

            <p>Our latest game, HistoHunters, has grown into a really big project that compilation now takes a really long time. Longer than no sane programmer wants it to be. It has gotten so bad that changing a single file would take about a minute for recompilation! </p>
<p>Thankfully, I have managed to shorten this wait time through the use of <a href="https://coffeebraingames.wordpress.com/2018/01/21/reducing-compile-time-in-unity-using-assembly-definition-files/">assembly definitions</a>. If you have a big Unity project and compile times are slow, this is the solution to that. Just for kicks I also purchased an SSD and that also helped reduce compile times (Not much as the assembly definitions though).</p>
<p>However, in spite of these changes compiling still takes a few seconds to reload scripts. This seems to be the lowest it could go. While this is definitely better, I can't help but feel that the seconds spent waiting is wasted.</p>
<p><img alt="making-unity-beep-after-scripts-finish-reloading-02" src="./images/making-unity-beep-after-scripts-finish-reloading-02.jpg" /></p>
<p>I recently got the idea of having Unity inform me when a script has finished reloading. Instead of informing me visually, I decided that it would also be better for it to play an audible beep sound. With this, I could use the time to close my eyes, relax, or stretch. Once it beeps I'll just open my eyes and I'm back to working again. Once it beeps I'll just open my eyes and I'm back to working again. It's such a simple thing but I feel has a good impact on my health.</p>
<p>Here's the code that I use if you are interested. Note that this is an editor script so it should be placed inside any "Editor" folder for it to run.</p>

<p>The code above uses Unity's <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/EditorApplication.Beep.html">EditorApplication.Beep()</a> API so it should work on Windows and Mac. But since I'm using Linux to develop games on it does not seem to work for me. </p>
<p>Here's a different version that spawns a OS process and runs the <code>play</code> command to generate a short sine wave beep. Be sure to have <a href="http://sox.sourceforge.net/">sox</a> installed on your Linux machine for this to work.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">ProcessStartInfo</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">proc</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">new</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">ProcessStartInfo</span><span class="p">();</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>Of course, this is not a solution to the compile time problem. I'd still have to wait for it to finish. But what I like about this is that it has turned a negative into a positive. And that is always great.</p>
