<ul>
<li>Packed malware machine learning classifier can only previously identify 10 packers</li>
<li>Solution was a customized version of model ensembling, which is to train multiple models and resolve their results</li>
<li>It works with a slight caveat of more extended training and processing, which I could happily live with</li>
</ul>
<p>I recently presented <a href="https://packers.vgl4nt.com/">VGL4NT</a>, my tool that uses machine learning to classify packed malware, at the Blackhat Middle East and Africa meetup. During my talk, I candidly shared one of the tool's limitations which is it can only identify 10 packers because of my hardware constraints. If I want it to be able to identify more, I need to get more GPU (which will be costly) or keep my money and come up with a clever solution. Well, this post is about the latter.</p>

                <p>The recent rise in popularity of AI reignited my interest in machine learning. It inspired me to dive deeper into understanding how it can be applied to malware analysis and, more importantly, how to better detect malware packers, as almost every malware nowadays uses them.</p>
<p>My research and experiments eventually led me to make a web app, which I call the VGL4NT Malware Packer Classifier (<a href="https://packers.vgl4nt.com/).">https://packers.vgl4nt.com/).</a>).</p>

<p>Traditional packer detection approaches like DiE (Detect it Easy) and Yara rules depend on known signatures and patterns to identify packers.

                <p>In the <a href="../malware-sandbox-evasion-in-x64-assembly-by-checking-ram-size-part-2.html">previous post</a>, I explored a sandbox evasion technique that uses <code>GetPhysicallyInstalledSystemMemory</code> to check the size of the RAM of the machine. The idea behind this technique (MBC Technique ID: <a href="https://github.com/MBCProject/mbc-markdown/blob/master/anti-behavioral-analysis/virtual-machine-detection.md">B0009.014</a>) is that any value that is lower than 4GB <em>may</em> probably be a sandbox (to reduce costs). This information can then be used with other sandbox evasion techniques to confirm.</p>
<p>For part 2 of this series, I'll be talking about an alternative Windows API function called <code>GlobalMemoryStatusEx</code>. This function is as straightforward as the first one, but requires the passing of a pointer to a C struct. This is significant because I'll be converting a working C code to x64 assembly so we can fully understand how it works under the hood.</p>
