        <p><p>After the recent changes to the <a href="../following-lispy-conventions.html">lisp side of my engine</a>, I took some time to review the C/C++ side. You'll notice that I have written C/C++ and that's because my codebase uses both of them. </p>
<p>When I started my project, I initially intended for it to use just pure C, as this is the one I'm more familiar with. But over time some C++ features crept in. Features like namespacess, bools, and function overloading proved to be useful so I kept using them. Now my code uses C concepts with new nifty C++ features.</p>
<p>Now, I could have just continued with this approach. It works, after all. But I wondered if I should just stick to C and drop C++ altogether. My thinking is that sticking with just one language would make the code simpler as I only have to use it's subset of features. I know it's not a solid reason but I figured it's better to act now while it is still early.</p>
<p><img alt="switching-from-c-c---to-c-01" src="../images/switching-from-c-c---to-c-01.png" /></p>
<p>For the most part, dropping C++ was easy. Most of the difficulty I encountered was making sure the changes worked on all three supported platforms. There was a situation when <a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel/rebel-game-engine/commits/cglm-switch-fix">I thought I was done</a> only to find it doesn't work on Mac and Windows. I had to <a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel/rebel-game-engine/commits/cglm-switch-fix">slowly re-apply</a> the changes just to see where exactly things went wrong.</p>
<p>What's funny is that I learned that I was using a lot more C++ features than I thought. Namespaces and default arguments …</p>

<p>I was adding new Lisp functions to <a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel/Rebel-Game-Engine">my game engine</a> when I noticed that I had functions that had a naming scheme that were inconsistent with others. For example, I had ones that create objects like <em>sprite_create</em> and <em>shader_create</em> but this one function I named <em>make_vec3</em>. I proceeded to rename <em>make_vec3</em> to <em>vec3_create</em>. Not only is it consistent with other names but it made me realize that having a pattern of object_verb makes it easy to parse the function and what it does. </p>
<p>This made me wonder if there are other ways I could improve which led me to this page <a href="http://community.schemewiki.org/?variable-naming-convention">about variable naming conventions</a> for Scheme. I learned that the language employs a rather effective yet simple naming convention for functions and variables. I've noticed them before but never really thought about their usefulness. </p>
<p>For example, adding a <em>?</em> prefix easily indicates that the function, when called, will always return a boolean value. I looked at my code and I had the function <em>is_key_down</em>. Changing it to <em>key_down?</em> looked weird at first but I liked how it made the function name shorter and the <em>?</em> prefix made it easy to spot and parse.</p>
<p>Okay, cool! What's next?</p>
<p>Adding a <em>!</em> indicates a function that mutates data. Most commonly used for setting a variable. I saw I had variables like <em>set_vec3_x</em>, to which I changed to <em>vec3_x!</em>.</p>
<p>This went on as I continue to find improvements. Here's a list of all …</p>
