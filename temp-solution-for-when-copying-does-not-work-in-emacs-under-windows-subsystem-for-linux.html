<p>It works quite nicely especially after integrating it with simpleclip. This would do for now until I find a better solution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>EDIT (2017-10-01):</strong> Turns out the original code could not copy a region with multiple lines due to the difference in carriage return characters. This is now fixed with <code>(replace-regexp-in-string "\n" "\r" str-val)</code>.</p>
