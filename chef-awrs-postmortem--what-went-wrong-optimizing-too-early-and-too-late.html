<hr />
<p>It is a well known adage among programmers that premature optimization is the root of all evil. If this is true then I must have been very close to the devil himself.</p>
<p>During the early months of development on Chef Wars I did my best to optimize my code as much as possible. We were making a big game and I wanted to have a stable foundation to build our game on. I obsessed over lots of things from the interconnection of the various systems to folder structures. I was happy with all that I've built, but sadly progress was slow.</p>
<p>I realized at this point that I was optimizing too prematurely. If I wanted to reach my milestones on time then I needed to change my approach. This means leaving the optimizations for later. When is later though? I figured that it makes sense to do it at the end when all the systems are in place.</p>
<p>All went smoothly until we reached Open Beta. The game was reported to be sluggish and almost unplayable which signaled the need to start optimizing. While I was able to optimize some parts, there were some that I could not optimize properly without undergoing a major change to the code. Sadly, rewrites were not an option as we were running out of time.</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>The profiler has been really helpful in catching performance problems.
</code></pre></div>

<p>Looking back it is easy to pinpoint what went wrong. I was optimizing too early, later changed my approach only to find out that I was already too late to optimize certain critical parts. I, of course, want to prevent this from happening again. So the million dollar question is: How does one determine when to optimize? How does one know when is too early and too late?</p>
<h2 id="the-complete-version">The complete version</h2>
<p>I later learned that the famous adage actually has a longer version:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered. We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="02" src="https://i.imgur.com/dqPF0cK.jpg" /></p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>From Donald Knuth&#39;s The Art of Computer Programming
</code></pre></div>

<p>Turns out there was more to the saying that completely changes the lesson to be learned. Breaking it down we can infer that the author is telling us that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Too much obsession over non-critical parts wastes time.</li>
<li>Only focus on efficiencies that matter.</li>
<li>Optimize whenever possible, but not at the expense of the previously mentioned points.</li>
</ul>
<p>So instead of asking WHEN to optimize, it is more important to ask WHAT and HOW to optimize. In other words, anytime there is a chance to evaluate if an optimization is needed, one needs to consider whether there really is something worthwhile to optimise, and if so, how to proceed in optimizing.</p>
<h2 id="answering-the-what-and-how">Answering the WHAT and HOW</h2>
<p>Knowing how to answer the WHAT and HOW is not easy and requires both experience and careful planning to get right. The internet is a bit divided about this as nobody really knows the best answer. In spite of this, I was able to gather some helpful nuggets of wisdom during my research that are worth considering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be critical of what optimizations to use at each stage of the project. Determine how critical it is and if it can be done later.</li>
<li>If setting aside optimizations for later, make sure to prepare the code so that it would be easy to do so when the time comes.</li>
<li>Proper planning during the design stage can determine what to build and how to optimize in advance.</li>
<li>Measuring/profiling optimizations would reveal which are the most effective to use in the future.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>There is a certain sense of pride in producing optimized and stable code. Sadly, this kind of perfection comes at a cost of time. The solution is to always consider at all times when, what, and how to optimize.</p>
<p>This may all seem overkill to worry about but after going through 2 years worth of development on Chef Wars, I know all of this is worth taking the extra effort to do right. I hope that what I've learned may also be of use to you.</p>
