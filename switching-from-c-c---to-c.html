        <p>After the recent changes to the <a href="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/following-lispy-conventions.html">lisp side of my engine</a>, I took some time to review the C/C++ side. You'll notice that I have written C/C++ and that's because my codebase uses both of them. </p>
<p>When I started my project, I initially intended for it to use just pure C, as this is the one I'm more familiar with. But over time some C++ features crept in. Features like namespacess, bools, and function overloading proved to be useful so I kept using them. Now my code uses C concepts with new nifty C++ features.</p>
<p>Now, I could have just continued with this approach. It works, after all. But I wondered if I should just stick to C and drop C++ altogether. My thinking is that sticking with just one language would make the code simpler as I only have to use it's subset of features. I know it's not a solid reason but I figured it's better to act now while it is still early.</p>
<p><img alt="switching-from-c-c---to-c-01" src="https://www.accidentalrebel.com/images/switching-from-c-c---to-c-01.png" /></p>
<p>For the most part, dropping C++ was easy. Most of the difficulty I encountered was making sure the changes worked on all three supported platforms. There was a situation when <a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel/rebel-game-engine/commits/cglm-switch-fix">I thought I was done</a> only to find it doesn't work on Mac and Windows. I had to <a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel/rebel-game-engine/commits/cglm-switch-fix">slowly re-apply</a> the changes just to see where exactly things went wrong.</p>
<p>What's funny is that I learned that I was using a lot more C++ features than I thought. Namespaces and default arguments are some that really surprised me. I always assumed they were supported on both languages. This just proves to me that I still have a lot to learn with these languages.</p>
<p>I also took the chance during the transition to switch from <a href="https://glm.g-truc.net/0.9.9/index.html">GLM</a>, an OpenGL Mathematics lirary using C++, to <a href="https://github.com/recp/cglm">CGLM</a> a similar library that uses C. It is claimed that the latter is more optimized and, with it being in C, is easier to integrate with my codebase.</p>
<p>While these changes did not do much in terms of progress, I am happy that my codebase now feels tighter and more coherent. I'm hoping to work on something engine-related next.</p>
