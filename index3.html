<h1 id="getting-the-password">Getting the password</h1>
<p>After the first two challenges I kinda know what to expect already so I skipped running the program and immediately loaded it in IDA.</p>
<p><img alt="ioli-crackme-0x02-01" src="./images/ioli-crackme-0x02-01.png" /></p>
<p>So the lines leading to the comparison command now looks more complicated than before. We could easily see that there are some computations that happens thanks to the presence of <code>add</code> and <code>imul</code>. Before those, we have two values (<code>5Ah</code> and <code>1ECh</code>) which we can easily guess are the values that will be worked on by these arithmetic functions.</p>
<p>So going through the lines sequentially we can see that the two numbers are first added with <code>add [eax], edx</code>. Which …</p>

<p>I've been playing around with <a href="https://remnux.org/">Remnux</a> and encountered a problem trying to get one of the tools to run properly. The tool is <a href="https://github.com/repnz/shellcode2exe">shellcode2exe</a>, it is used to compile binary shellcode to a file so it can easily be debugged by a debugger.</p>
<p>When I checked out the code, I was surprised to find out how simple it is. Basically, what happens is that the inputted shellcode is added to a barebones assembly file using the <code>incbin</code> assembly instruction. From there, the file is then automatically compiled and linked.</p>
<p>One big problem with the tool is that it needs to use <a href="https://www.winehq.org/">Wine</a> if it needs to run on Linux. I don't want such a huge dependency especially for my own malware analysis lab so I decided to write my own version which have led to the creation of <code>shcode2exe</code>.</p>

<h1 id="getting-the-password">Getting the password</h1>
<p>Of course, the first thing we do is run the program.</p>
<p><img alt="ioli-crackme-0x01-01" src="./images/ioli-crackme-0x01-01.png" /></p>
<p>Just like last time, we opened up the program in IDA and focused on the part of the code that does the comparing of passwords.</p>
<p><img alt="ioli-crackme-0x01-02" src="./images/ioli-crackme-0x01-02.png" /></p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nf">cmp</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="no">ebp</span><span class="err">+</span><span class="no">var_4</span><span class="p">],</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">149</span><span class="no">Ah</span>
<span class="nf">jz</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">short</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">loc_40137c</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This seems easy enough. </p>
<p>Initially I entered <code>149A</code> as the password but this turned out to be incorrect. The reason for this is because <code>scanf</code> was passed a format of <em>"%d"</em>.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nf">mov</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="no">esp</span><span class="err">+</span><span class="mi">18</span><span class="no">h</span><span class="err">+</span><span class="no">Format</span><span class="p">],</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">offset</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">aD</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="c1">; &quot;%d&quot;</span>
<span class="nf">call</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">_scanf</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This means that the input it expects is actually a decimal integer. So converting <code>149A</code> to decimal results in <code>5274 …</code></p>

        <p><p>I am re-familiarizing myself with reverse engineering again by going through some simple crackme challenges. This one is called the IOLI Crackmes by pof. The goal is to find the correct password and also to patch it so that it can accept any input and still show that it's correct.</p>
<h2 id="getting-the-password">Getting the password</h2>
<p>Running the program shows a password prompt. </p>
<p><img alt="ioli-crackme-0x00-03" src="./images/ioli-crackme-0x00-03.png" /></p>
<p>Of course, randomly entering passwords is going to be a waste of time so I opened up IDA to look at its code.</p>
<p>I knew that whatever password I enter in the program would be checked against the actual password. This is the part of the program that I should focus on so I scanned the code and found this:</p>
<p><img alt="ioli-crackme-0x00-02" src="./images/ioli-crackme-0x00-02.png" /></p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nf">mov</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="no">esp</span><span class="err">+</span><span class="mi">38</span><span class="no">h</span><span class="err">+</span><span class="no">Str2</span><span class="p">],</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">offset</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">Str2</span><span class="c1">; &quot;250382&quot;</span>

<p>Yesterday I participated in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/guidemtraining">GuideM "Hunt the Kingdom" CTF challenge</a>. It served as the final activity at the end of the <em>"Cyber Defense and Threat Hunting"</em> course.</p>
<p>I was looking forward to this CTF, especially after my awesome experience with the <a href="./covidscammers-writeup--defcon-rtv-ctf.html">Red Team Village CTF at Defcon</a>. This one is centered on the Blue Team side, and I was curious as to how it will play out.</p>
<h2 id="the-preparation">The Preparation</h2>
<p>I took one whole day to study and prepare. I went through all our slides and have written down the important concepts and commands to an org file. This is important because I wanted them to be easily searchable, which helped a lot during the challenge.</p>
<p>I also did research about the Hunt the Kingdom challenge itself. There weren't much information online about it …</p>

        <p><p>I've done a lot of electronics projects already, all of them were painstakingly hand-soldered on a perfboard. I actually like this approach for quick prototyping, and plus, I've also grown fond of how "raw" it looks like. In spite of this, I've always been curious and interested in having my own printed PCB. I remember designing one for my <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/164144-tiro-vibrating-watch/log/161430-current-state-and-next-steps">TIRO vibrating watch</a> but I never pushed through with it because I wasn't confident with what I've made.</p>

<p>Any network capable device has a unique factory-assigned Media Access Control (MAC) address. Users have no way to change the MAC address but it can be done. However, it is possible to mask the MAC address and have it show a different value. This is called MAC spoofing.</p>
<p>There are legitimate uses for MAC spoofing. For example, there may be certain applications that require a particular MAC address to work, or maybe your ISP expects a certain MAC address to connect to the network. MAC spoofing is largely used for illegitimate uses, like circumventing an access control list or getting past a filter on a wireless network.</p>
<h2 id="changing-mac-address-via-ifconfig">Changing MAC Address via ifconfig</h2>
<p>In Linux we could use <code>ifconfig</code> to change the MAC address.</p>

        <p><p>After the recent changes to the <a href="./following-lispy-conventions.html">lisp side of my engine</a>, I took some time to review the C/C++ side. You'll notice that I have written C/C++ and that's because my codebase uses both of them. </p>
<p>When I started my project, I initially intended for it to use just pure C, as this is the one I'm more familiar with. But over time some C++ features crept in. Features like namespacess, bools, and function overloading proved to be useful so I kept using them. Now my code uses C concepts with new nifty C++ features.</p>
<p>Now, I could have just continued with this approach. It works, after all. But I wondered if I should just stick to C and drop C++ altogether. My thinking is that sticking with just one language would make the code simpler as I only have to use it's subset of features. I know …</p>
