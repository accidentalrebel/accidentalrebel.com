        <p><p>I've long wondered if I should add a scripting language to <a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel/Rebel-Game-Engine">my game engine</a>. I know that most game engines could do without such a feature but I just recently came across <a href="https://github.com/ashinn/chibi-scheme">Chibi-Scheme</a>, a library that allows the use of Scheme lisp scripting for C programs. </p>
<p>I like Lisp. I use it a lot when customizing my Emacs environment (<a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel?tab=repositories&amp;q=&amp;type=&amp;language=emacs+lisp">using ELisp</a>). There's something about it's syntax and different way to structure programs that appeals to my programmer brain. I've toyed with other Lisp flavors but never had a strong enough reason to continue using them. With Chibi-scheme I may have found that reason.</p>
<p><img alt="thinking-of-adding-lisp-to-my-custom-game-engine-01" src="./images/thinking-of-adding-lisp-to-my-custom-game-engine-01.jpg" /></p>
<p>I am aware that Lisp is not as widespread as Lua or Javascript. And that choosing it might limit the number of potential people to try out my game engine. But as I've been telling myself over and over, this is a self-learning project. So it's okay if no one would try it out as long as I get to learn from it.</p>
<p>This morning I started implementing a simple implementation of Chibi. Thankfully, it's easy to setup. However, the more I implement it the more that I realize that I may need to change how my engine is structured to better suit Lisp's functional nature. This means less object oriented design similar to how <a href="https://www.raylib.com/index.html">Raylib</a> does things. </p>
<p>I still need some time to think this through. I am open to do the changes needed if I am to include a scripting language. I just want to make sure if my engine would really need it. We'll see.</p>

        <p><p>Our latest game, HistoHunters, has grown into a really big project that compilation now takes a really long time. Longer than no sane programmer wants it to be. It has gotten so bad that changing a single file would take about a minute for recompilation! </p>
<p>Thankfully, I have managed to shorten this wait time through the use of <a href="https://coffeebraingames.wordpress.com/2018/01/21/reducing-compile-time-in-unity-using-assembly-definition-files/">assembly definitions</a>. If you have a big Unity project and compile times are slow, this is the solution to that. Just for kicks I also purchased an SSD and that also helped reduce compile times (Not much as the assembly definitions though).</p>
<p>However, in spite of these changes compiling still takes a few seconds to reload scripts. This seems to be the lowest it could go. While this is definitely better, I can't help but feel that the seconds spent waiting is wasted.</p>
<p><img alt="making-unity-beep-after-scripts-finish-reloading-02" src="./images/making-unity-beep-after-scripts-finish-reloading-02.jpg" /></p>
<p>I recently got the idea of having Unity inform me when a script has finished reloading. Instead of informing me visually, I decided that it would also be better for it to play an audible beep sound. With this, I could use the time to close my eyes, relax, or stretch. Once it beeps I'll just open my eyes and I'm back to working again. Once it beeps I'll just open my eyes and I'm back to working again. It's such a simple thing but I feel has a good impact on my health.</p>
<p>Here's the code that I use if you are interested. Note that this is an editor script so it should be placed inside any "Editor" folder for it to run.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="k">using</span> <span class="nn">System.Collections</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The code above uses Unity's <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/EditorApplication.Beep.html">EditorApplication.Beep()</a> API so it should work on Windows and Mac. But since I'm using Linux to develop games on it does not seem to work for me. </p>
<p>Here's a different version that spawns a OS process and runs the <code>play</code> command to generate a short sine wave beep. Be sure to have <a href="http://sox.sourceforge.net/">sox</a> installed on your Linux machine for this to work.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">ProcessStartInfo</span> <span class="n">proc</span> <span class="p">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="n">ProcessStartInfo</span><span class="p">();</span>

<span class="n">Process</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">Start</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">proc</span><span class="p">);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Of course, this is not a solution to the compile time problem. I'd still have to wait for it to finish. But what I like about this is that it has turned a negative into a positive. And that is always great.</p>

        <p><p><img alt="01" src="https://i.imgur.com/9XWvvi0.png" /></p>
<p>I've recently embarked on a mission to fully integrate <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> with my Unity game development environment. One feature that I wanted to have is the ability to open Unity scripts and text-based files in Emacs instead of MonoDevelop. This is an easy task for supported external editors but for those who aren't (Like Emacs), doing something like this is a bit tricky.</p>
<p>Setting <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Invoking-emacsclient.html">emacsclient</a> as the external editor works in opening the files but the line number is not passed at all (Or is not received by emacs. <a href="https://forum.unity.com/threads/external-editor-arguments-issue.350473/">Seems to be a bug</a>). This means that opening files in the Project Window works but you would not be able to to jump to lines that have errors from the Console. This, of course, is unacceptable.</p>
<p><img alt="02" src="https://i.imgur.com/8gcVuom.png" /></p>
<p>I've tried a number of different solutions. A lot of them are hacky but clever. There was this one option of setting a <a href="https://github.com/bbbscarter/EmacsProxy">Sublime Text proxy</a> as a external editor and then having that application call Emacs with the correct line number. I was not able to make it work but the idea fascinated me. There was also one that involved using Mac OS X's Automator where you <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/1857220">wrap a shell script as an automator app</a> and you set that as the external editor. Didn't work either but it did teach me about Automator and it's future possible uses for my environment.</p>
<p>Thankfully, there was one solution that worked and it involved creating a .cs file and setting up a function with OnOpenAssetAttribute callback attribute. This function is called when Unity receives a command to open an asset. From here we start a process that invokes emacsclient with the correct file and line numbers. </p>
<p>Here is a short example:</p>

        <p><p><strong>Note: This is from a <a href="http://www.accidentalrebel.com/tags/chefwars_postmortem/">series of articles</a> that outlines the things I've learned while making <a href="http://mindcakegames.com/">Chef Wars</a> for 2+ years.</strong></p>
<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>We used a risk adjusted estimation system that produces near accurate estimates we can confidently rely on.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>I usually dreaded being asked how long a programming task will take. I always seem to have the knack to overshoot no matter how hard I try. This is an all too common scenario that programmers face and is something that is considered to be a difficult, if not impossible, problem to solve.</p>
<p><img alt="01" src="https://i.imgur.com/KqCZUHl.jpg" /></p>
<p>This all changed when I was introduced to a helpful system that helps in producing estimates that are "accurate enough". I don't think it has a name yet but my colleagues who introduced me to it says that they got it from a <a href="https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/181992/waterfall_game_development_done_.php">Gamasutra article</a> by Eric Preisz of Garage Games. Since then I've used this system in all my game development related projects and has helped us immensely in the development of our recent game, <a href="http://mindcakegames.com/">Chef Wars</a>.</p>
<p>I'm sharing this in the hopes that it would help others too.</p>
<h2 id="risk-adjusted-estimates">Risk Adjusted Estimates</h2>
<p>The basic idea of this system is that for each task, an estimated time would be given along with a "confidence level". The lower the confidence the more padding is added automatically to the estimate for that task.</p>
<p>It's a very simple system and is illustrated clearly in the image below:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Task</th>
<th align="center">Estimate</th>
<th align="center">Confidence</th>
<th align="right">Risk-Adjusted</th>

<p>A legend (shown below) is used to help programmers determine what confidence level to specify based on their current situation.</p>

<p>The formula for calculating the risk-adjusted time is also very straightforward:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(estimated time * (10 - confidence level) / 9) + estimated time</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From hereon you can easily compute for the total time and make a comparison between the estimated time and the risk adjusted time.</p>
<p>To see how all of this works you can check out our <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KNTq88bw5qO6Ejbm71z31X-jraJDjB-9WET-2BZR2-s/edit?usp=sharing">Technical Estimate Template Sheet</a> at our Google Drive. Or if you are into Emacs, I also have a <a href="https://gist.github.com/accidentalrebel/0df9f9e024c7e3d433ef8a4f9fada2a9">template for that as well</a> using OrgMode.</p>

<p>As you can see that the actual times are very close to the risk adjusted times. I overshot quite a bit during the UI related tasks but the time lost was offseted by the other tasks as seen in the totals. </p>
<p>Take note that this is just a small sample and results will vary. There are times where totals still overshoot but mostly it is just in terms of a few hours, or at worst a full day. Regardless, our overall experience has been great as it has proven to be accurate enough that we could confidently commit to certain dates and schedules.</p>
<h2 id="tips-on-using-this-system">Tips on using this system</h2>
<ul>
<li>This system works great if you know the tasks beforehand. You really need to sit down and think what the steps are and try not to miss anything and to avoid adjustments.</li>
<li>The more granular the tasks, the easier it is to assign a time and confidence level to them.</li>
<li>Being honest with the confidence levels helps produce more accurate estimates. It also brings to light any low-confidence tasks that are in need of reconsideration.</li>
<li>Make the scope smaller and easier to digest by dividing your project into smaller parts (It can be by milestone or by module) and then make an estimate for each.</li>
<li>Do this long enough and you'll get better with judging estimates and confidence levels.</li>
<li>It helps to review and compare how long a task took against your estimates. It will give you insight why you overshot (In the example above, I learned that I am still bad at properly estimating UI related tasks. I should adjust my confidence levels for next time).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This simple system has helped us a lot and we plan to use it on all our future projects. It's not 100% accurate but it is accurate enough that we can schedule confidently with it. I would be the first to admit that it may not work for everyone but if you are always overshooting your estimates then this system might be worth a try.</p>

        <p><p><strong>Note: This is from a <a href="http://www.accidentalrebel.com/tags/chefwars_postmortem/">series of articles</a> that outlines the things I've learned while making <a href="http://mindcakegames.com/">Chef Wars</a> for 2+ years.</strong></p>
<p><strong>TLDR</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>There is more to the saying that "premature optimization is the root of all evil".</li>
<li>Instead of asking WHEN to optimize, it is more important to ask WHAT and HOW to optimize.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>It is a well known adage among programmers that premature optimization is the root of all evil. If this is true then I must have been very close to the devil himself.</p>
<p>During the early months of development on Chef Wars I did my best to optimize my code as much as possible. We were making a big game and I wanted to have a stable foundation to build our game on. I obsessed over lots of things from the interconnection of the various systems to folder structures. I was happy with all that I've built, but sadly progress was slow.</p>
<p>I realized at this point that I was optimizing too prematurely. If I wanted to reach my milestones on time then I needed to change my approach. This means leaving the optimizations for later. When is later though? I figured that it makes sense to do it at the end when all the systems are in place.</p>
<p>All went smoothly until we reached Open Beta. The game was reported to be sluggish and almost unplayable which signaled the need to start optimizing. While I was able to optimize some parts, there were some that I could not optimize properly without undergoing a major change to the code. Sadly, rewrites were not an option as we were running out of time.</p>
<p><img alt="01" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/26n6T9MrKZ2Qo16Vy/giphy.gif" /></p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>The profiler has been really helpful in catching performance problems.
</code></pre></div>

<p>Looking back it is easy to pinpoint what went wrong. I was optimizing too early, later changed my approach only to find out that I was already too late to optimize certain critical parts. I, of course, want to prevent this from happening again. So the million dollar question is: How does one determine when to optimize? How does one know when is too early and too late?</p>
<h2 id="the-complete-version">The complete version</h2>
<p>I later learned that the famous adage actually has a longer version:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Programmers waste enormous amounts of time thinking about, or worrying about, the speed of noncritical parts of their programs, and these attempts at efficiency actually have a strong negative impact when debugging and maintenance are considered. We should forget about small efficiencies, say about 97% of the time: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Yet we should not pass up our opportunities in that critical 3%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img alt="02" src="https://i.imgur.com/dqPF0cK.jpg" /></p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>From Donald Knuth&#39;s The Art of Computer Programming
</code></pre></div>

<p>Turns out there was more to the saying that completely changes the lesson to be learned. Breaking it down we can infer that the author is telling us that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Too much obsession over non-critical parts wastes time.</li>
<li>Only focus on efficiencies that matter.</li>
<li>Optimize whenever possible, but not at the expense of the previously mentioned points.</li>
</ul>
<p>So instead of asking WHEN to optimize, it is more important to ask WHAT and HOW to optimize. In other words, anytime there is a chance to evaluate if an optimization is needed, one needs to consider whether there really is something worthwhile to optimise, and if so, how to proceed in optimizing.</p>
<h2 id="answering-the-what-and-how">Answering the WHAT and HOW</h2>
<p>Knowing how to answer the WHAT and HOW is not easy and requires both experience and careful planning to get right. The internet is a bit divided about this as nobody really knows the best answer. In spite of this, I was able to gather some helpful nuggets of wisdom during my research that are worth considering:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be critical of what optimizations to use at each stage of the project. Determine how critical it is and if it can be done later.</li>
<li>If setting aside optimizations for later, make sure to prepare the code so that it would be easy to do so when the time comes.</li>
<li>Proper planning during the design stage can determine what to build and how to optimize in advance.</li>
<li>Measuring/profiling optimizations would reveal which are the most effective to use in the future.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>There is a certain sense of pride in producing optimized and stable code. Sadly, this kind of perfection comes at a cost of time. The solution is to always consider at all times when, what, and how to optimize.</p>
<p>This may all seem overkill to worry about but after going through 2 years worth of development on Chef Wars, I know all of this is worth taking the extra effort to do right. I hope that what I've learned may also be of use to you.</p>

<p><strong>TLDR</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All data in our game is contained in one excel file we call the "Universe".</li>
<li>Prototypes can be done on the Universe excel file itself</li>
<li>Iteration is easier as we only need to change one file.</li>
<li>We made a system that downloads changes from our server so players don't need to update their builds.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Before we started development on Chef Wars, Cliff, my co-founder and game designer for the team, already had pages of spreadsheets containing important values in the game. It's kinda like a game design document but in the form of tables, columns, and rows. This "Universe" file contained everything from stats, dialogue, competitions, locations, chefs, and enemies just to name a few. </p>
<p><img alt="01" src="https://i.imgur.com/rVZqbaH.png" /></p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>*This file definitely gives a hint on what type of guy Cliff is.*
</code></pre></div>

<p>Having a list of all the data that will be used in the game has helped us visualize the scope and the systems to be built, especially in making prototypes. One time Cliff made a simulation of the battle system using his Excel mastery. The universe data is fed into this simulation (i.e. competition level, recipe power) and the expected values are displayed (i.e. judging result, rewards amount). This mockup allowed us to see how the battles play out and made the whole thing easier for me to understand and implement in the engine.</p>
<p>All the content of the universe file is then converted to the JSON format which is used directly by the game. Iterating on the game is easy because the file would just need to be converted again for the new changes to show up. The conversion process is done manually though using a CSV to JSON tool. I would have automated the process but didn't have the time to work on it.</p>
<p><img alt="02" src="https://i.imgur.com/lE5zqDu.png" /></p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>*It&#39;s like the Matrix*
</code></pre></div>

<p>Initially, when we wanted to update some values, we would need to push a new build version that players need to download. We figured that this is too cumbersome especially if we really have some critical changes we want to get out as soon as possible. As a solution to this, we made a system where a master copy of the JSONs are saved on our servers. We can change the data from here and the game would automatically download the necessary files that we changed. This is a really great feature that has helped us push important changes without having the need for a new build. But it does require a lot of bandwidth especially if a lot of players request for the new data so we do it only when needed like on crash producing bugs.</p>
<p>As you can see, we've spent a lot of time making sure that our game is data-centric as possible and it benefitted us immensely. This approach has been so useful that we plan to use it on our future projects. And hopefully, after reading this, we've convinced you to try it out too.</p>

        <p><p>One of the problems I was having with my Emacs environment under WSL <em>(Windows Subsystem for Linux, aka. Bash On Windows)</em> is that I could not copy text from WSL Emacs to other Windows applications. Copy and pasting from Windows to Emacs works without any problems so it's weird it does not work the other way around.</p>
<p>I tried a lot of solutions from Google but none of them seem to work. There was an emacs package called <a href="https://github.com/rolandwalker/simpleclip">simpleclip</a> that worked but the results were not consistent.</p>
<p>I then realized that a temporary solution would be to make use of Windows' clip.exe command line utility which can bme seen below.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defun</span> <span class="nv">arebel-set-clipboard-data</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">str-val</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="s">&quot;Puts text in Windows clipboard. Copying to Windows from WSL does </span>
<span class="s">not work on my end so this one is a temporary solution.</span>

<span class="s">This function is called from within the simpleclip package when copy </span>
<span class="s">or bgcopy command is issued.&quot;</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">start-process</span> <span class="s">&quot;cmd&quot;</span> <span class="no">nil</span> <span class="s">&quot;cmd.exe&quot;</span> <span class="s">&quot;/C&quot;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">concat</span> <span class="s">&quot;echo &quot;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">replace-regexp-in-string</span> <span class="s">&quot;\n&quot;</span> <span class="s">&quot;\r&quot;</span> <span class="nv">str-val</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="s">&quot; | clip.exe&quot;</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>It works quite nicely especially after integrating it with simpleclip. This would do for now until I find a better solution.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>EDIT (2017-10-01):</strong> Turns out the original code could not copy a region with multiple lines due to the difference in carriage return characters. This is now fixed with <code>(replace-regexp-in-string "\n" "\r" str-val)</code>.</p>

        <p><p>Since my recent switch from Wordpress to <a href="https://github.com/kelvinh/org-page">org-page</a> I wanted a way to convert my org-journal entries to org-page posts. Instead of copying each entry by hand and pasting to an org-page new page buffer I decided to make an elisp code that would do it automatically which can be seen below:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defun</span> <span class="nv">arebel-org-journal-entry-to-org-page-post</span> <span class="p">()</span>
  <span class="s">&quot;Copy the org-journal entry at point and then convert it to a org-page new post buffer.&quot;</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">interactive</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">eq</span> <span class="ss">&#39;org-journal-mode</span> <span class="nv">major-mode</span><span class="p">)</span>
      <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">let</span> <span class="p">((</span><span class="nv">headline-text</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">nth</span> <span class="mi">4</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">org-heading-components</span><span class="p">)))</span>
        <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">entry-text</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">org-get-entry</span><span class="p">)))</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">funcall-interactively</span> <span class="ss">&#39;op/new-post</span> <span class="s">&quot;blog&quot;</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">concat</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">buffer-name</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="s">&quot;-&quot;</span> <span class="nv">headline-text</span><span class="p">))</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">goto-char</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">point-max</span><span class="p">))</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">insert</span> <span class="nv">entry-text</span><span class="p">))</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">message</span> <span class="s">&quot;This function can only be called inside org-journal-mode.&quot;</span><span class="p">))</span> <span class="p">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The function is simple and uses functions from org-mode and org-page.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, it checks if the current buffer is in org-journal-mode</li>
<li>Then it gets the headline text and entry texts</li>
<li>It then calls op/new-post. It does it interactively so that it will trigger the prompts needed to populate the template. (Also notice that it takes the org-journal buffer name plus time as the blog post's org file name. This way I don't have to specify it.)</li>
<li>It then inserts the entry-text at the end of the buffer.</li>
</ul>
<p>From here I am free to edit, commit, then publish.</p>
<p>It's working great. As proof this post you are reading right now has been made with the code above.</p>
