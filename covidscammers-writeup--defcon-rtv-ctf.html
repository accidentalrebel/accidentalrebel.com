        <p>I joined the <a href="https://ctf.threatsims.com">Defcon Red Team Village CTF</a> because I was curious about it and I wanted to test out the skills that I have gained playing with CTF sites like <a href="https://overthewire.org/wargames/">overthewire.org</a> and <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/">vulnhub</a>. I knew that the challenges won't be easy, but thankfully, I was able to join up with other newbies who were willing to give it a go and learn with each other.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I fell asleep just before the CTF started and when I woke up all the easy challenges were already solved by my team members. There was one easy challenge that was still open on the CovidScammers category, so I quickly got started to solving that.</p>
<h2 id="free-flag-and-binary-1-point">Free Flag (and binary) [1 point]</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You've been contacted by a high-end but morally ambiguous finance company (unhackable-bitcoin-wallet.com) to investigate a data breach. The box in question is a mail server in their internal network, a sample of the malware found on the system has been pulled and given to you. Your task, should you choose to accept it, is to reverse-engineer the sample and locate, fuzz and exploit the C2 server, and then hack-back to learn about the malicious actor and recover the stolen documents.
Look for the free flag. Get on the scoreboard!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I admit that in a hurry to get points I did not properly read the description of the challenge. I understood that I'll be downloading and reverse-engineering something. But it did not register on my mind that it's actually malware.</p>
<p>The download was a binary that doesn't do anything when run. My first instict was to use <code>strings</code> to look for the flag, which turned out to be correct.</p>
<p><img alt="giving-malware-to-a-noob--defcon-rtv-ctf-covidscammers-writeup-01" src="./images/giving-malware-to-a-noob--defcon-rtv-ctf-covidscammers-writeup-01.png" /></p>
<p>The flag is: <code>TS{freeFlagLookAtMe}</code>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this challenge was already solved by a team member so I did not get the free flag. The second one, is still open though.</p>
<h2 id="syscalls-5-points">Syscalls [5 points]</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>What syscall is hindering your dynamic analysis? Flag is just the syscall, no brackets or anything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we run the file from within gdb to debug it we get:</p>
<p><img alt="giving-malware-to-a-noob--defcon-rtv-ctf-covidscammers-writeup-02" src="./images/giving-malware-to-a-noob--defcon-rtv-ctf-covidscammers-writeup-02.png" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>can't debug this, na na na na...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So from the description we are looking for a syscall that is hindering the debugging of the binary. If we want to find out what syscalls are called by a program, we could determine that using the <code>strace</code> command.</p>
<p><img alt="giving-malware-to-a-noob--defcon-rtv-ctf-covidscammers-writeup-03" src="./images/giving-malware-to-a-noob--defcon-rtv-ctf-covidscammers-writeup-03.png" /></p>
<p>Just before the write syscall for the "na na na" message we see:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ptrace(TRACE_TRACEME) = -1 EPERM (Operation not permitted)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm unfamiliar with <code>ptrace</code> so I researched it and tried to understand how it could prevent debugging. I learned that <code>ptrace</code> can be used as an anti-debugging technique as can be seen <a href="https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/Ptrace-anti-debugging">here</a>.</p>
<p>Sure, enough the flag is: <code>ptrace</code>. </p>
<p>I got 5 points from this and I finally have a contribution to my team! Unfortunately, real life prevented me from continuing with the CTF and I had to bow out early.</p>
<h3 id="sidenote-how-to-bypass-ptrace">Sidenote: How to bypass ptrace?</h3>
<p>How does one bypass this anti-debugging feature? <a href="https://dev.to/denisnutiu/bypassing-ptrace-calls-with-ldpreload-on-linux-12jl">Here's one approach</a> that I tried which should work in theory but doesn't. My guess is that this particular binary has an additional way to prevent debugging, like it spawns a child process and it stays there even if you bypass ptrace. I'd have to look into this further in the future.</p>
<h2 id="shared-secrets-150-points">Shared Secrets [150 points]</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The malware creates a shared-memory object and stores a flag inside. Recover the flag. Flag has the TS{} format, you'll know when you get it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was able to solve this challenge after the CTF preliminaries ended. By this time I was already well rested and have a clearer mind. It was also at this time that I realized that the file is actually a malware and has already infected my machine. Thankfully, I was running a virtual machine which meant I could just revert back to an old working restore point.</p>
<p>Knowing that the file is a malware, the next step I did was to run <code>rkhunter</code> to look for rootkits and suspcious files. This gave me an interesting finding:</p>
<p><img alt="giving-malware-to-a-noob--defcon-rtv-ctf-covidscammers-writeup-04" src="./images/giving-malware-to-a-noob--defcon-rtv-ctf-covidscammers-writeup-04.png" /></p>
<p>Opening the suspicious file revealed this: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>KRJXW22FMVYES5CTMVBXERKUNNCWK4CJORJWCRTFFZGXERTSGBSE6IL5</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not the flag yet, it needs to be in the "TS{}" format as instructed in the challenge description.</p>
<p>I initially had a hard time figuring out how to decode this. It wasn't <code>base64</code> nor any other popular encoding. Thankfully, there are tools like <a href="https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/">CyberChef</a> to help with this kind of problem. After some experimentation, the "magic" recipe did the trick and revealed to me that it was actually a <code>base32</code> encoding.</p>
<p><img alt="giving-malware-to-a-noob--defcon-rtv-ctf-covidscammers-writeup-05" src="./images/giving-malware-to-a-noob--defcon-rtv-ctf-covidscammers-writeup-05.png" /></p>
<p>This gave me the flag: <code>TS{kEepItSeCrETkEepItSaFe.MrFr0dO!}</code></p>
<h2 id="license-and-registration-100-points">License and Registration [100 points]</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The malware creates a UUID and stores it in a file, what is the name of this file. Provide the SHA1 hash of hte full path as the flag.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the description above says that a file is created by the malware and stores data inside of it. I figured that the easiest way to figure out what this created file is to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Restore to a previous restore point before I opened the malware</li>
<li>Run the malware, and then;</li>
<li>Inspect which other files were created at the time of execution. </li>
</ul>
<p>I found out which files were recently created during the last 2 minutes using the following command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>find<span class="w"> </span>/<span class="w"> </span>-user<span class="w"> </span>kali<span class="w"> </span>-mmin<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">2</span><span class="w"> </span>-type<span class="w"> </span>f<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">2</span>&gt;<span class="w"> </span>/dev/null
</code></pre></div>

<p>This showed me a lot of files, but after sifting through that I found one file that seesm promising.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>/tmp/.serverauth.tn6aUcM0uM</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To get the flag I did this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">echo</span><span class="w"> </span>-n<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;/tmp/.serverauth.tn6aUcM0uM&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>sha1sum
</code></pre></div>

<p>Which resulted in this flag: <code>5b4e97047851682649a602ad62ba4af567e352a3</code></p>
<h2 id="to-be-continued">To be continued?</h2>
<p>So I wanted to try and work on the other challenges but it seems that <a href="https://ctf.threatsims.com">the ctf site</a> is currently down. The site redirected to a different non https site and it spooked me so I stopped trying. Good thing that I had NoScript on.</p>
