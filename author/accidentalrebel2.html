            <p>I gave a 10-minute lightning talk at the recently concluded Blackhat Middle East &amp; Africa community meetup. The topic is about Mitre's Malware Behavior Catalog (MBC) framework and the existing tools for it. My reason for selecting this topic is because I feel that more people should know about Mitre's not-so-well-known project.</p>

<h2 id="a-brief-overview">A brief overview</h2>
<p>MBC is a framework made by Mitre, similar to ATT&amp;CK, but focuses on malware. It lists down the common objectives and behaviors commonly seen in malware. The purpose is to have standardize reporting so that everyone would use the same definitions when writing and talking about malware. This also aids with analysis and correlation with other tools.</p>
<p>It has it's own matrix with malware objectives as headers for columns and an entry for each behavior. Each behavior then has a list of methods that explains how that behavior is achieved, example of malware that uses …</p>

            <p>In <a href="string-av-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-1">my last blog post</a>, I discussed a way to hide parameter strings from being detected by an anti-virus. The solution was simple and it worked. However, it was incomplete as strings of function calls and loaded DLLs were still detectable in memory.</p>

            <p>One of the features I implemented for my <a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel/RATwurst">Remote Access Tool</a> was an anti-virus evasion capability in the form of strings obfuscation. It wouldn't fool an EDR or a reverse engineer but it was quick to implement so I added it. </p>
<p>This was over a year ago. I decided to revisit this feature to try and understand it better and find out if it is actually effective.</p>

<p>I'll be going through sections of the C file and show the how it can be written accordingly in x64 Windows assembly. Take note, however, that the conversion is not one-to-one, meaning there are other ways of writing it. What I did was to structure the assembly code so that you can easily compare it with the C code while making sure that the end result will be the same.</p>

Verify this hypothesis and find the name of the WMI Event Consumer used by the attacker to maintain his foothold.</p>

            <p>I am continuing my reverse engineering review by tackling the <em>IOLI crackmes</em> by <a href="https://twitter.com/pof">@pof</a>. These are beginner friendly challenges that is perfect for newbies or for those who want to review the basics like me. Check out my writeups for <a href="../ioli-crackme-0x00.html">0x00</a>, <a href="../ioli-crackme-0x01.html">0x01</a>, <a href="../ioli-crackme-0x02.html">0x02</a>, and <a href="../ioli-crackme-0x03.html">0x03</a>.</p>
<h1 id="getting-the-password">Getting the password</h1>
<p>Loading the program in IDA revealed something new. There is now a <code>_check</code> function that when opened looks more complicated than the previous challenges.</p>
<p><img alt="ioli-crackme-0x04-01" src="../images/ioli-crackme-0x04-01.png" /></p>
<p>The one thing that I immediately noticed is the call to the <code>_strlen</code> function similar to the previous challenge. This means that the length of the input string plays another important role.</p>
<p>One curious thing is the condition that leads to the "Password Incorrect" block, as shown below.</p>

<p>From the looks of it, the check will fail if <code>var_C</code> (Which is our <code>var_counter</code> from the previous challenge) reaches the …</p>

            <p>I have recently realized that one part of cybersecurity that I am lacking basic knowledge on is networking. I honestly did not think it was important when I was starting. It was the reason why I skipped Network+ so I could take Security+ directly. </p>
<p>Now I know better.</p>
<p>Ever since my realization, I have taken steps to patch the holes in my knowledge. I've started taking courses and bought books. But one thing that has made the most impact is me building my very own "homelab".</p>
<p>I first came to know of the concept of homelabs <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/">from Reddit</a>. To those unfamiliar, it is the practice of building a networked environment to gain practical knowledge in networking and IT. One way to do this is by making a virtual network.</p>
<p>And so, over the past month, I have been building my very own virtual homelab with a focus on integrating cybersecurity …</p>
