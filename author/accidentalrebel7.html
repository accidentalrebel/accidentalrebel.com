        <div class="article-content">
            <p>Since my last post about <a href="investigating-an-fb-phishing-site">my investigations of a Facebook phishing site</a>, I have received several messages from friends asking me to check out other suspected phishing/scam sites. One of the most alarming out of them was this one where I was able to find the file where the scammer stores the phished usernames and passwords.</p>
<p><img alt="finding-phished-passwords-from-a-scam-site-01" src="../images/finding-phished-passwords-from-a-scam-site-01.png" /></p>
<p>This particular phishing site conducts its operations like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>An ad is shown on Facebook, promising free coupons for famous fast food restaurants</li>
<li>Clicking on the ad takes the user to a fake Facebook login page hosted on <em>blogger.com</em></li>
<li>Login page then sends phished username and passwords to a PHP file hosted on <em>000webhost</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The phished passwords are then stored in a <code>.txt</code> file (blatantly named, <code>victims.txt</code>), which is publicly accessible on an open directory. Getting to this directory involved following the scripts and the URLs used by the scammers. It's not that hard to find as long as you know where to look.</p>
<p>What's scary is that the size of this text file kept on getting bigger. I knew I had to act quickly.</p>
<h2 id="stopping-the-scammers">Stopping the scammers</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, with phishing sites like these, there's not much we could do but report it to the relevant hosting providers. The problem is that sometimes it may take some time before the site gets reviewed, which is excruciating because the longer the wait, the more people fall victim. Some might even just ignore your report altogether!</p>
<p>I reported the fake login page to Blogger.com and did not receive any response at all. I understand that Blogger.com is a big platform and I bet they receive numerous reports like this. I guess this is why the scammer used this platform as they know they won't be taken down too quickly. Their profile even listed two sites that both had fake login pages. </p>
<p><img alt="finding-phished-passwords-from-a-scam-site-04" src="../images/finding-phished-passwords-from-a-scam-site-04.png" /></p>
<p>Thankfully, <em>000webhost</em> got back to me and eventually took down the page that hosted the PHP and text files.</p>
<p><img alt="finding-phished-passwords-from-a-scam-site-03" src="../images/finding-phished-passwords-from-a-scam-site-03.png" /></p>
<p>You'd think that this is a victory. But sadly, setting up a new phishing site is rather easy so within a few hours there is already a new one. Of course, I reported this new site too. Only for a new one to pop up later...</p>
<p>You can see how this can become an endless cat and mouse game.</p>
<h2 id="stopping-from-other-sources">Stopping from other sources</h2>
<p>One way that could be effective to stop the scammer's operations is by reporting the Facebook advertisement that is used to lure users to the phishing site. Unfortunately, my friend who shared this with me did not get a chance to snap a screenshot of the ad. If he did then it would probably have more impact on stopping their operations. Maybe the Facebook abuse team can trace the payment details used to pay for the ad, and maybe block it. </p>
<p><img alt="finding-phished-passwords-from-a-scam-site-02" src="../images/finding-phished-passwords-from-a-scam-site-02.png" /></p>
<p>If you know anyone who may have seen a Facebook advertisement that offers free coupon codes for fast food restaurants that might be pointing to a suspicious login page, then please do contact me!</p>
<h2 id="awareness-is-the-key">Awareness is the key</h2>
<p>As of this posting, the landing page is still up while the page that hosts the PHP and victims file is down. I'm sure it'll be back up soon. All I was able to do was delay their operations. A minor inconvenience for them.</p>
<p><img alt="finding-phished-passwords-from-a-scam-site-05" src="../images/finding-phished-passwords-from-a-scam-site-05.png" /></p>
<p>This is why out of everything, spreading awareness is the best countermeasure. If people are more aware of phishing sites and how to avoid them then that would greatly diminish their impact. This is why I continue to post and write about phishing sites. Seeing the number of victims rising like that made me act knowing that I at least have the power to prevent things from escalating.</p>
<p>And you have the power too, dear reader. Educate your family and friends by warning them or by showing them my posts. Remember, awareness is our best defense!</p>

<p>This is a writeup for <a href="the-emprisa-maldoc-challenge">Emprisa maldoc challenge</a> that I made for <a href="https://cyberdefenders.org/">CyberDefenders.org</a>. You can play it <a href="https://cyberdefenders.org/labs/56">here</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The very first thing that I do when confronted with a malicious document is to run it in a malware lab. This particular document, however, would not exhibit anything malicious on recent versions of Word.</p>
<p>A quick search of the hash on malware sandboxes would reveal that the document makes use of the <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-18822">CVE-2017-18822 vulnerability</a>. This is a vulnerability that became known and was promptly patched around November of 2017.</p>
<p>The above details give us a hint on how to trigger the document, which is to run the maldoc on a version of Microsoft Word that doesn't have the patches that fix the vulnerability. The easiest way to do this is to boot up a new VM with a fresh install of Windows 7 and with updates disabled.</p>
<p>This new environment is where the document would trigger once double-clicked. After a bit of loading, a pop-up would later appear greeting the analyst with congratulations (this is a stand-in for a malicious payload for this challenge), but of course, it is clear that we are not done yet.</p>
<p><img alt="emprisa-maldoc-writeup-01" src="../images/emprisa-maldoc-writeup-01.png" /></p>
<p>Tools such as <a href="https://processhacker.sourceforge.io/">Process Hacker</a> will reveal a new process named <code>EQNEDT32.EXE</code> getting spawned right after opening the document. Those who have read through the CVE details would know that this is the expected behavior, as the vulnerability uses this process to run malicious code. In this case, the exploit downloads a file from the internet and automatically runs it.</p>
<p>Another tool such as <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/regshot/">Regshot</a> would reveal newly created files. It can determine these by taking a snapshot before the malicious document is opened, then taking another one after the downloaded payload gets triggered, and finally comparing the two snapshots and listing the differences. It's an invaluable tool to have.</p>
<p><img alt="emprisa-maldoc-writeup-02" src="../images/emprisa-maldoc-writeup-02.png" /></p>
<p>Running <a href="https://github.com/DidierStevens/DidierStevensSuite/blob/master/rtfdump.py">rtfdump.py</a> would then reveal some telling details about our maldoc, like for example, magic signatures and object streams.</p>
<p>Upon close inspection of the hexdump of the largest object stream (still via rtfdump), one would see a sequence of NOPs (aka a NOPsled) in certain parts. A NOPsled such as this usually indicates the possible start of shellcode. Carving this part of the shellcode and running it on an emulator such as <a href="https://github.com/fireeye/speakeasy">speakeasy</a> or <a href="http://sandsprite.com/blogs/index.php?uid=7&amp;pid=152">scdbg</a> won't work properly, however.</p>
<p><img alt="emprisa-maldoc-writeup-03" src="../images/emprisa-maldoc-writeup-03.png" /></p>
<p>The output shows the first line to be <code>LoadLibrary</code>, and then there's an error after that. This indicates that maybe there's a problem with the shellcode. </p>
<p>On further inspection, a little more further down there is another set of seemingly readable strings. This could indicate another shellcode. Or, maybe, a continuation of the first one? In between these supposed two shellcodes is a readable string that seems out of place in between the gibberish. Carving the two shellcodes and then combining them would now work when run on an emulator.</p>
<p><img alt="emprisa-maldoc-writeup-04" src="../images/emprisa-maldoc-writeup-04.png" /></p>
<p>If the previous solution was not immediately clear to you then there is another approach to the above. And that is to step through the <code>EQNEDT32</code> process as soon as it runs. However, attaching to this process is tricky as it triggers only for a split second and then exits. To debug this, a debugger should be automatically connected as soon as the process starts. Check out <a href="https://pentestlab.blog/2020/01/13/persistence-image-file-execution-options-injection/">this post</a> for details on how to do this.</p>
<p>Once attached, the painstaking process of debugging begins. Thankfully, we have an idea of what code is being loaded into memory. And this is the shellcode that has a NOPSled during our analysis with rtfdump.py above. Looking for this sequence and then putting a breakpoint where the memory location is accessed would stop the program just before the shellcode is run. Once the breakpoint triggered, we could step through the shellcode and find out what exactly the shellcode does and which Libraries are being called.</p>
<p>From here, we could also backtrack from where the shellcode is called to figure out how the exploit is triggered via a buffer overflow. This requires a bit of knowledge in reverse engineering. An alternative is to <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-18822">check out the CVE details</a> in search for the tool that was likely used to make the exploit, and then examining the code.</p>
<p>After all of that, you should have everything that you need to answer all the questions in the challenge. You may have noticed that I have not revealed the answers outright. You still have to find it on your own. However, I do hope that by walking you through the process, I have helped you understand how to get there.</p>

        <div class="article-content">
            <p>Last April 21, people were posting warnings about a suspicious Facebook post where your account will supposedly get hacked when you click it. From the discussions, I gathered that it is a classic phishing site scam. A very effective one too, because as soon as an account gets compromised the attacker logs in and tags the friends in the account allowing it to spread further. The news of this got big that even the PH CERT issued <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Ncertgovph/posts/1879686332199270">a security advisory on it</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="checking-the-fb-phishing-site-02" src="../images/checking-the-fb-phishing-site-02.jpg" /></p>
<h1 id="i-was-just-curious-i-swear">I was just curious, I swear!</h1>
<p>I wanted to see the phishing site for myself but I was unlucky and did not get tagged by anyone. So I reached out to people who did and I eventually got to this page shown below:</p>
<p><img alt="checking-the-fb-phishing-site-01" src="../images/checking-the-fb-phishing-site-01.png" /></p>
<p>To a trained eye, one could easily see the obvious red flags. But how can one notice them if there is a very attention-catching image in the middle beckoning to be clicked? It's a very simple tactic yet very effective. Clicking this link leads to an external website with an even more tantalizing image masquerading as a video. </p>
<p><img alt="checking-the-fb-phishing-site-03" src="../images/checking-the-fb-phishing-site-03.png" /></p>
<p>Clicking play on that video would then lead to a fake Facebook login page. We all know what's next after that. </p>
<p><img alt="checking-the-fb-phishing-site-06" src="../images/checking-the-fb-phishing-site-06.png" /></p>
<p>Of course, the very best course of action when a phishing site is discovered is to report it. I, however, was curious so I decided to poke around first.</p>
<h1 id="the-poking-begins">The poking begins</h1>
<p>Using my knowledge in OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) and pentesting, I poked around to see what I could learn from these set of pages.</p>
<p>One thing that immediately became obvious was that these "set of pages" were hosted on separate domains. The page with the video points to one domain, and the login page to another (that is even protected by DDNS (Dynamic DNS) via No-IP). </p>
<p><img alt="investigating-an-fb-phishing-site-08" src="../images/investigating-an-fb-phishing-site-08.png" /></p>
<p>I also noticed that the way that the two pages were built was different. The coding style is not the same, different frameworks were used, plus the robots.txt of the login page was more restrictive. </p>
<p>Why are they in separate domains? Wouldn't it be cheaper to just have both pages on the same domain? </p>
<p>My hunch is that maybe the two sites were made by different people. One guy made the landing page then a different one made the login page. Or maybe the login page is an out-of-the-box solution you pay for or rent if you want to set up your own phishing scam? A PhAAS (Phishing-as-a-Service)?</p>
<p><img alt="investigating-an-fb-phishing-site-09" src="../images/investigating-an-fb-phishing-site-09.png" /></p>
<p>During my reconnaissance, I also noticed that the URLs for the login page were changed a few times over a few hours. It's possible that the pages were being taken down thanks to the reports and the malicious actors were just making new instances and redirecting to it to make sure that the operation continues.</p>
<h1 id="ang-nhap-hoac-ang">Đăng nhập hoặc đăng</h1>
<p>Another thing I noticed is references to various Vietnamese terms and websites. Both pages have directories using the word "homnay", Vietnamese for the word "today". The source code also has a link to the news website "tuoitre.vn". </p>
<p><img alt="checking-the-fb-phishing-site-04" src="../images/checking-the-fb-phishing-site-04.png" /></p>
<p>The Google Analytics ID used can also be found in previously tagged but now-defunct Phishing websites with references to Vietnam. It's entirely possible that these phishing sites initially targeted Vietnamese users but eventually got to Philippine users via the tagging spreading mechanism.</p>
<p><img alt="checking-the-fb-phishing-site-05" src="../images/checking-the-fb-phishing-site-05.png" /></p>
<p>Or maybe it's a deliberate ploy to make it seem that the origin of the phish is Vietnamese. Just to throw off those of us snooping around.</p>
<h1 id="and-then-it-was-gone">And then it was gone</h1>
<p>I was tempted to make a dummy Facebook account and send the login details to the phishing site. The idea was to see how long before an account gets accessed after submitting the credentials and if the tagging of friends is automated or done manually. But sadly I ran out of free time and by the time I came back to it the login page was already completely offline. The landing page is still up though.</p>
<p>This investigation has taught me a lot about phishing sites. It's different from investigating malware but it's easy to see the similarities in intent and approaches. I might try investigating more in the future. I'm curious to find out what the usual <em>modus operandi</em> is and also how the general populace can better protect themselves from it. </p>
<p>This particular site may be down now, but I bet there will be more in the future. As long as there are people to fall for scams like these, this type of attack will continue.</p>
