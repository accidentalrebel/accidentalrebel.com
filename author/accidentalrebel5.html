            <p>I have released a new cybersecurity-related tool called <a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel/vATTACK">vATT&amp;CK (Visual ATT&amp;CK)</a>. It is a relationship visualizer for the Mitre ATT&amp;CK framework.</p>
<p><img alt="new-tool-preview-vattack-01" src="../images/new-tool-preview-vattack-01.png" /></p>
<p>What the tool does is that it makes a visual map of the searched technique and all the related information. You can watch a video of the tool in action <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCc7aAqbSNI">here</a>.</p>
<p>Each node will be colored depending on it's category. The color legends is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pink - Related subtechniques</li>
<li>Orange - Malware that uses the searched technique</li>
<li>Red - Groups that uses the searched technique</li>
<li>Blue - Tools that use the searched technique</li>
<li>Yellow - Mitigations</li>
</ul>
<p>This tool is still in development. I plan to add a number of improvements such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to click on nodes and then update the visual map</li>
<li>Ability to search not just by technique, but also by other categories</li>
</ul>
<p>I also plan on releasing a live demo of the tool very soon in the hopes of getting feedback from the community. </p>
<p>For now, if you are interested in the project, you could visit the <a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel/vATTACK">tool's Github project page</a> or contact me for any comments or suggestions.</p>

            <p>I am continuing my reverse engineering review by tackling the <em>IOLI crackmes</em> by <a href="https://twitter.com/pof">@pof</a>. These are beginner friendly challenges that is perfect for newbies or for those who want to review the basics like me. Check out my writeups for <a href="../ioli-crackme-0x00.html">0x00</a>, <a href="../ioli-crackme-0x01.html">0x01</a>, <a href="../ioli-crackme-0x02.html">0x02</a>, and <a href="../ioli-crackme-0x03.html">0x03</a>.</p>
<h1 id="getting-the-password">Getting the password</h1>
<p>Loading the program in IDA revealed something new. There is now a <code>_check</code> function that when opened looks more complicated than the previous challenges.</p>
<p><img alt="ioli-crackme-0x04-01" src="../images/ioli-crackme-0x04-01.png" /></p>
<p>The one thing that I immediately noticed is the call to the <code>_strlen</code> function similar to the previous challenge. This means that the length of the input string plays another important role.</p>
<p>One curious thing is the condition that leads to the "Password Incorrect" block, as shown below.</p>
<p><img alt="ioli-crackme-0x04-02" src="../images/ioli-crackme-0x04-02.png" /></p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="nf">call</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">_strlen</span>
<span class="nf">cmp</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">[</span><span class="no">ebp</span><span class="err">+</span><span class="no">var_C</span><span class="p">],</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">eax</span>
<span class="nf">jnb</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">short</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="no">loc_401387</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>From the looks of it, the check will fail if <code>var_C</code> (Which is our <code>var_counter</code> from the previous challenge) reaches the length of the entered string. If you think about it, this means that it doesn't matter how long the string that the user inputs. What's important is the content.</p>
<p>To find out what the correct content the program expects, we need to look at the other block of code.</p>
<p><img alt="ioli-crackme-0x04-03" src="../images/ioli-crackme-0x04-03.png" /></p>
<p>The code uses the same approach as the previous challenge where <code>var_counter</code> is used to loop through individual characters in the input string.</p>
<p>The part that is new is the use of the <code>_sscanf</code> function which is defined as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"sscanf reads data from s and stores them according to parameter format into the locations given by the additional arguments, as if scanf was used, but reading from s instead of the standard input (stdin)."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Looking at how the function <code>_sscanf</code> is used, it gets each character in the input string and converts them to decimal integers. This means that the password can only contain the numbers <em>0 through 9</em>. The reason for this is because the result is added to another value at the line <code>add [eax], edx</code>.</p>
<p>This <em>"other value"</em> is the converted integer value from previous loops. This means that the algorithm adds each number from the input string after every loop. For example, an input string of <code>123</code> translates to <code>1+2+3</code> where the computed sum is saved to <code>var_8</code>.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the line <code>cmp [ebp+var_8], 0Fh</code>, which tells us that the program expects the computed sum to be equal to <code>0Fh</code> or <code>15</code>. So as long as we enter numbers that would equal to <code>15</code> when combined, then we are good.</p>
<p><img alt="ioli-crackme-0x04-" src="../images/ioli-crackme-0x04-.png" /></p>
<h1 id="patching-the-executables">Patching the executables</h1>
<p>Patching the executable is different this time around. If on previous challenges we patched the program by changing an conditional opcode to a jmp (<code>74</code> to <code>EB</code>), for this one we only need to change the conditional to a <code>no op</code> instruction (<code>00</code>).</p>
<p><img alt="ioli-crackme-0x04-05" src="../images/ioli-crackme-0x04-05.png" /></p>
<p>As you can see, the line <code>cmp [ebp+var_8]</code> and the conditional branch disappears allowing us to go directly to the <em>"Password OK"</em> part of the code.</p>
<p><img alt="ioli-crackme-0x04-06" src="../images/ioli-crackme-0x04-06.png" /></p>
<h1 id="on-to-the-next-challenge">On to the next challenge...</h1>
<p>I liked this challenge mostly because it changed the passwords the program expects. The first time I tackled this challenge I used purely static analysis. I thought I got the answer only to realize that I was wrong by debugging the code. We have 5 more challenges to go!</p>

        <div class="article-content">
            <p>I have recently realized that one part of cybersecurity that I am lacking basic knowledge on is networking. I honestly did not think it was important when I was starting. It was the reason why I skipped Network+ so I could take Security+ directly. </p>
<p>Now I know better.</p>
<p>Ever since my realization, I have taken steps to patch the holes in my knowledge. I've started taking courses and bought books. But one thing that has made the most impact is me building my very own "homelab".</p>
<p>I first came to know of the concept of homelabs <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/">from Reddit</a>. To those unfamiliar, it is the practice of building a networked environment to gain practical knowledge in networking and IT. One way to do this is by making a virtual network.</p>
<p>And so, over the past month, I have been building my very own virtual homelab with a focus on integrating cybersecurity products.</p>
<h1 id="the-lab">The Lab</h1>
<p>The network diagram below shows the current implementation of my lab. I will be discussing each part to give an idea of their purpose (<a href="../images/building-my-virtual-cybersecurity-home-lab-00.png">Click here for a bigger version</a>).</p>
<p><img alt="building-my-virtual-cybersecurity-home-lab-01" src="../images/building-my-virtual-cybersecurity-home-lab-01.png" /></p>
<p>At the heart of the network is a firewall running <a href="https://www.pfsense.org/">pfSense</a>. Its purpose is to ensure that each sub-network is separated and protected, and also to protect my virtual host from any malware outbreaks. This machine also serves as a DHCP and NTP server to all the machines in the network.</p>
<p><img alt="building-my-virtual-cybersecurity-home-lab-13" src="../images/building-my-virtual-cybersecurity-home-lab-13.png" /></p>
<h1 id="the-target-network">The Target Network</h1>
<p>On the right side of the diagram is the "Target" network where workstations and vulnerable servers reside. These are the machines that I use to attack with exploits and malware.</p>
<p><img alt="building-my-virtual-cybersecurity-home-lab-02" src="../images/building-my-virtual-cybersecurity-home-lab-02.png" /></p>
<p>I have Metasploitable 2 and Metasploitable 3 machines that have various services turned on to play around with. I can learn about specific attacks by exploiting this machine, but I can also don my defenders hat and learn about how to secure them.</p>
<p>The Windows and Linux machines will serve as typical workstations for various experiments.</p>
<p>One of the perks of my job is that I get to play with different cybersecurity solutions. I currently have access to a few that I am able to use on my lab for testing.</p>
<p>One solution that I am using right now is an EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) (Sorry, I can't reveal which). Each machine has an EDR agent deployed which monitors for any malicious activities on the host. It has an anti-virus feature, anti-ransomware, and fileless attack monitoring. It's awesome stuff but I have yet to maximize this.</p>
<p>An IDS (intrusion Detection System) running <a href="https://www.snort.org/">Snort</a> monitors the traffic for any malicious activity. Signatures are constantly updated to ensure that I can detect the latest types of attack. If it finds anything important, it then sends an alert to a SIEM (running <a href="https://www.splunk.com/">Splunk</a>) on the Management network.</p>
<p><img alt="building-my-virtual-cybersecurity-home-lab-11" src="../images/building-my-virtual-cybersecurity-home-lab-11.png" /></p>
<h1 id="the-management-network">The Management Network</h1>
<p>On the left side of the diagram is the Managemnet network. This is where the management part of the EDR, IDS, and the SIEM can be accessed from my virtual host.</p>
<p><img alt="building-my-virtual-cybersecurity-home-lab-03" src="../images/building-my-virtual-cybersecurity-home-lab-03.png" /></p>
<p>There's nothing special about this network, I do want to note though that I find it interesting the Snort IDS has two interfaces. One is used for access to the management page, and the other is for sniffing traffic on the Attacker network.</p>
<h1 id="the-operations-network">The Operations Network</h1>
<p>At the bottom side of the diagram is the "Operations" network.</p>
<p>A machine running Kali is placed here. I can launch attacks from this machine towards the vulnerable machines on the Target network. This machine also has OpenVAS scanner that helps in discovering vulnerabilities on the target machines.</p>
<p><img alt="building-my-virtual-cybersecurity-home-lab-04" src="../images/building-my-virtual-cybersecurity-home-lab-04.png" /></p>
<p>A windows machine serves as my malware analysis lab. It contains a lot of malware analysis tools to aid with investigations. </p>
<p>This machine is then connected to a <a href="https://remnux.org/">Remnux</a> Linux machine. All traffic from the Windows machine is port forwarded by Remnux. From here I can run Wireshark to inspect the traffic coming from the Windows malware lab and it can also spoof the network responses to influence the behavior of malware. If the Remnux machine is turned off, then the Windows machine is effectively cut off from the whole network. It's a really neat setup that <a href="https://www.ariefprabowo.com/en/malware-analysis-en/personal-notes-building-a-malware-analysis-lab-environment/">I learned here</a>.</p>
<h1 id="the-present">The Present</h1>
<p>While the main intent of the network is to learn networking and implementing cybersecurity products, I can also investigate malware and learn about exploits by launching attacks. So it has a lot of multiple uses, which is perfect for someone like me who gets interested in different aspects of cybersecurity.</p>
<p>My host machine currently has 32GB, 8 cores, and a total of 1.75TB which may seem a lot but is not powerful enough for all the machines to run at the same time. As a workaround, I just open the machines that I need for a particular exercise.</p>
<p><img alt="building-my-virtual-cybersecurity-home-lab-05" src="../images/building-my-virtual-cybersecurity-home-lab-05.png" /></p>
<p>For example, if I want to investigate malware then I only need the firewall, Remnux, and the windows malware lab open. But if I want to attack and run an exploit, while making sure that it gets detected, then I need the firewall, EDR, IPS, SIEM, Kali, and the target machine to be open at the same time. This easily consumes around 20GB+!</p>
<h1 id="the-future">The Future</h1>
<p>Working on this homelab has taught me a lot of practical knowledge. It helped solidify a lot of networking concepts I've learned througout the years.</p>
<p>I'm not stopping here though. I also plan to upgrade the Target network so it would better resemble an enterprise network. For example, setting up an active directory, an internal DNS server, and maybe even a mail server (why not?). This is so I could play around in detecting and remediating more varied enterprise-level scenarios.</p>
<p>I am also hoping I could get access to more cybersecurity products so I could play around with them. A SOAR (Security Orchestration and Response) would be a nice addition that would work really well.</p>
<p>But, of course, before I could do any of the above I first need to upgrade my RAM and add more cores!</p>
