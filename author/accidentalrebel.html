        <p><p>I gave a 10-minute lightning talk at the recently concluded Blackhat Middle East &amp; Africa community meetup. The topic is about Mitre's Malware Behavior Catalog (MBC) framework and the existing tools for it. My reason for selecting this topic is because I feel that more people should know about Mitre's not-so-well-known project.</p>

<h2 id="a-brief-overview">A brief overview</h2>
<p>MBC is a framework made by Mitre, similar to ATT&amp;CK, but focuses on malware. It lists down the common objectives and behaviors commonly seen in malware. The purpose is to have standardize reporting so that everyone would use the same definitions when writing and talking about malware. This also aids with analysis and correlation with other tools.</p>
<p>It has it's own matrix with malware objectives as headers for columns and an entry for each behavior. Each behavior then has a list of methods that explains how that behavior is achieved, example of malware that uses …</p>

        <p><p>In <a href="string-av-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-1">my last blog post</a>, I discussed a way to hide parameter strings from being detected by an anti-virus. The solution was simple and it worked. However, it was incomplete as strings of function calls and loaded DLLs were still detectable in memory.</p>
<p><img alt="string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-2-01" src="../images/string-anti-virus-evasion-in-x64-assembly-part-2-01.png" /></p>
<p>In this post I'll be talking about the other technique from the same <a href="https://blog.scrt.ch/2020/07/15/engineering-antivirus-evasion-part-ii/">blog post</a> we were following before. It does a good job of explaining the concept which I'll be covering here too. I will also be writing the code in assembly as an added bonus, so we can better understand what goes on under the hood.</p>

        <p><p>One of the features I implemented for my <a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel/RATwurst">Remote Access Tool</a> was an anti-virus evasion capability in the form of strings obfuscation. It wouldn't fool an EDR or a reverse engineer but it was quick to implement so I added it. </p>
<p>This was over a year ago. I decided to revisit this feature to try and understand it better and find out if it is actually effective.</p>

<p>In this two-part blog post I will look into the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hiding argument strings</li>
<li>Hiding API call strings</li>
</ul>
<p>THe one you reading now is about the first one. I will be explaining how it's done in C and later convert it to x64 Windows Assembly so we can better understand what's happening under the hood.</p>

<p>I started this project as a way to deepen my understanding of assembly so I could be better in malware development and reverse engineering (And also because I love coding in assembly and would always find an excuse to use it).</p>
<h2 id="what-to-expect">What to expect</h2>
<p>I'll be going through sections of the C file and show the how it can be written accordingly in x64 Windows assembly. Take note, however, that the conversion is not one-to-one, meaning there are other ways of writing it. What I did was to structure the assembly code so that you can easily compare it with the C code while making sure that the end result will be the same.</p>

<p>Question 11. As a result of running a malicious code, which we talk about in questions 9 and 10, the attacker got a shell on the compromised host. Using this access, the attacker downloaded the Active Directory collection utility to the host in an encoded form.

<p>This one is easy. Using the same date range from the previous question, I changed the query to <code>event_type:DNSReq</code> (where "DNSReq" is short for "DNS Requests").</p>

<p>Question 1. The Threat Hunting process usually starts with the analyst making a hypothesis about a possible compromise vector or techniques used by an attacker. In this scenario, your initial hypothesis is as follows: "The attacker used the WMI subscription mechanism to obtain persistence within the infrastructure". Verify this hypothesis and find the name of the WMI Event Consumer used by the attacker to maintain his foothold.</p>

<p>What the tool does is that it makes a visual map of the searched technique and all the related information. You can watch a video of the tool in action <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xCc7aAqbSNI">here</a>.</p>
<p>Each node will be colored depending on it's category. The color legends is as follows:</p>

<li>Pink - Related subtechniques</li>
<li>Orange - Malware that uses the searched technique</li>
<li>Red - Groups that uses the searched technique</li>
<li>Blue - Tools that use the searched technique</li>
<li>Yellow - Mitigations</li>
</ul>
<p>This tool is still in development. I plan to add a number of improvements such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ability to click on nodes and then update the visual map</li>
<li>Ability to search not just by technique, but also by other categories</li>
