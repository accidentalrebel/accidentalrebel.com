<p>TLDR: Participated in a blue team CTF, had a lot of fun, looking forward for more</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yesterday I participated in the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/guidemtraining">GuideM "Hunt the Kingdom" CTF challenge</a>. It served as the final activity at the end of the <em>"Cyber Defense and Threat Hunting"</em> course.</p>
<p>I was looking forward to this CTF, especially after my awesome experience with the <a href="./covidscammers-writeup--defcon-rtv-ctf.html">Red Team Village CTF at Defcon</a>. This one is centered on the Blue Team side, and I was curious as to how it will play out.</p>
<h2 id="the-preparation">The Preparation</h2>
<p>I took one whole day to study and prepare. I went through all our slides and have written down the important concepts and commands to an org file. This is important because I wanted them to be easily searchable, which helped a lot during the challenge.</p>
<p>I also did research about the Hunt the Kingdom challenge itself. There weren't much information online about it but there were <a href="https://www.facebook.com/guidemtraining/photos/a.142012317191141/229536238438748/">some social media posts</a> that contained screenshots on how the challenge looked like. These gave me a lot of information on what to expect.</p>
<p><img alt="hunt-the-kingdom-ctf-challenge-01" src="./images/hunt-the-kingdom-ctf-challenge-01.jpg" /></p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>It&#39;s OSINT in practice :P
</code></pre></div>

<p>For example, with the screenshot above I learned how the UI looked like, that there were categories that we could switch to, leaderboards, how a question is structured, and that "areas" on the map can get added, enabled, and disabled during the game. The last part is particularly important as it means that not all questions are available from the start and some can get disabled during the game.</p>
<p>Thanks to the above research I felt confident that I could hit the ground running as soon as the game started. I picked my name (AccidentalRebel, of course) and my emblem and I was ready for the hunt.</p>
<p><img alt="hunt-the-kingdom-ctf-challenge-02" src="./images/hunt-the-kingdom-ctf-challenge-02.png" /></p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>Yes, that&#39;s the blue tank from Advance Wars, because I&#39;m part of the &quot;blue team&quot;.
</code></pre></div>

<h2 id="the-hunt">The Hunt</h2>
<p>When the hunt started my approach was to focus on the easy problems first. Getting them out of the way early would allow me to rack up points and just focus on the hard ones afterwards. This did the trick and I was able to maintain an early lead.</p>
<p>During the mid-game my computer hanged from all the switching between VMs (There were 3 VMs that we needed to use to solve the problems). <em>Note to self: get a beefier PC</em>. I got a bit frustrated by this but decided that instead of waiting for Windows to boot I could use the time to take a break and got lunch. </p>
<p><img alt="hunt-the-kingdom-ctf-challenge-03" src="./images/hunt-the-kingdom-ctf-challenge-03.53" /></p>
<p>I came back to the game all full and refreshed, but sadly, I have already lost my lead. I felt a bit disappointed by this but I continued to push through. I removed the leaderboards to minimize distractions which helped. No need to pressure myself, I told myself. Although, I admit that I did peek from time to time.</p>
<p>With the renewed focus I was able to keep my standing in the top 3. The leader of the pack during the end-game was <em>BoyHack3r</em>, a worthy opponent who was always a few points ahead of me. </p>
<p>There was one question that has a lot of points that only has one solve. I knew that if I could get that it would give me enough points to snatch back 1st place. It wasn't an easy problem though so I changed my approach by slowing down which helped me understand the questions better. A few minutes later I was back at first place.</p>
<p>I've never done a celebratory fist pump before, this was the first time.</p>
<h2 id="the-final-minutes">The Final Minutes</h2>
<p>I was able to maintain first place position by continuously answering questions until I was left with just four questions. These four are problems that no one has solved yet. The activity on the leaderboards have lessened which I took to mean that the others were stuck like me. I was at 13740 points, BoyHack3r at 13590, and Overwatch at 13460. If any of them managed to solve just one out of these four problems then they'll easily overtake me.</p>
<p>I wasn't going to let that happen though. At 5 minutes left I continued solving the one that I had the most progress with. But it wasn't enough and I ran out of time. The others didn't get their lucky break either which finally cemented the scores on the boards.</p>
<p><img alt="hunt-the-kingdom-ctf-challenge-04" src="./images/hunt-the-kingdom-ctf-challenge-04.PNG" /></p>
<p>After 6 hours of back-breaking hunting I was finally able to breathe a sigh of relief. </p>
<h2 id="the-end">The End</h2>
<p>I rarely engage in any competitive activity so my competitive side rarely comes out. This CTF definitely brought it out and gave me the push to take the challenge seriously. I didn't do it for the prizes though. I did it because I wanted to prove to myself that I have what it takes, especially since I don't have a formal background in CyberSecurity. While a CTF is not an accurate qualification of being part of a blue team, it does show a participant's ability to work and solve problems under pressure.</p>
<p>I want to give a shoutout to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/guidemtraining">GuideM</a> for guiding us throughout the course and for the extremely fun CTF challenge. Also to <em>BoyHack3r</em>, <em>Overwatch</em>, and <em>:]</em> for making me sweat bullets.</p>
<p>This is another big step for me into the world of cybersecurity and I do hope I could learn more and improve. I look forward to the next CTF!</p>

            <p>I've done a lot of electronics projects already, all of them were painstakingly hand-soldered on a perfboard. I actually like this approach for quick prototyping, and plus, I've also grown fond of how "raw" it looks like. In spite of this, I've always been curious and interested in having my own printed PCB. I remember designing one for my <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/164144-tiro-vibrating-watch/log/161430-current-state-and-next-steps">TIRO vibrating watch</a> but I never pushed through with it because I wasn't confident with what I've made.</p>
<p><img alt="my-experience-manufacturing-printed-circuit-boards-01" src="./images/my-experience-manufacturing-printed-circuit-boards-01.jpg" /></p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>I really like the raw, almost electronic-punk look of my work
</code></pre></div>

<p>A couple of months ago I got an email from <a href="https://www.pcbway.com/">PCBWay</a> asking if I was interested in trying out their PCB manufacturing service. The email from PCBWay re-ignited this interest in having a PCB made. The problem is I didn't have a PCB design that I built myself that I knew was going to work. My best option was the "ESPBoy project".</p>
<p>The <a href="https://hackaday.io/project/164830-espboy-the-ultimate-multi-gadget">ESPBoy</a> is a project by <a href="https://hackaday.io/ESPboy.edu">RomanS</a> that is touted to be the ultimate multi-gadget. RomanS sent me a kit a long time ago (Thank's again, RomanS). I have assembled and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIrp5Vpr2Ns&amp;feature=emb_title">made a tutorial video</a> for it which means that I know that it works and have a very good idea of how it is laid out.</p>
<p>With that decided, having the PCB made was a very easy and quick process. I just uploaded the gerber file on the PCBWay website, waited for the review of the PCB to be finished, and in a few hours I clicked the submit button and it was off to the printers.</p>
<p>Fast forward a few weeks later and the package with the printed pcbs arrived.</p>
<p><img alt="my-experience-manufacturing-printed-circuit-boards-02" src="./images/my-experience-manufacturing-printed-circuit-boards-02.jpg" /></p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>And yes, I changed the color to red just so they would look different.
</code></pre></div>

<p>I must say that I am very impressed with the quality of the PCBs. The material feels really solid and the lines so fine and accurate. I've seen and held PCB etchings before, and this is like lightyears ahead in terms of quality. The same can be said with my hand soldered perfboards, of course.</p>
<p>Sadly, these PCBs have been sitting in storage because I haven't found the time due to the baby. Thankfully, my schedule is slowly opening up recently and I plan to build one ESPBoy in the next coming weeks. I plan to remove the parts from the old one and put it on this. This newer PCB design has new features like the ability to connect to an app store (yeah, seriously) and I'm really curious to try it out.</p>
<p>I also might consider having another PCB made, but this time with my own design. I'm thinking I might go ahead and have my TIRO watch made, or maybe something even simpler. We'll see.</p>

        <div class="article-content">
            <p>I joined the <a href="https://ctf.threatsims.com">Defcon Red Team Village CTF</a> because I was curious about it and I wanted to test out the skills that I have gained playing with CTF sites like <a href="https://overthewire.org/wargames/">overthewire.org</a> and <a href="https://www.vulnhub.com/">vulnhub</a>. I knew that the challenges won't be easy, but thankfully, I was able to join up with other newbies who were willing to give it a go and learn with each other.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I fell asleep just before the CTF started and when I woke up all the easy challenges were already solved by my team members. There was one easy challenge that was still open on the CovidScammers category, so I quickly got started to solving that.</p>
<h2 id="free-flag-and-binary-1-point">Free Flag (and binary) [1 point]</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You've been contacted by a high-end but morally ambiguous finance company (unhackable-bitcoin-wallet.com) to investigate a data breach. The box in question is a mail server in their internal network, a sample of the malware found on the system has been pulled and given to you. Your task, should you choose to accept it, is to reverse-engineer the sample and locate, fuzz and exploit the C2 server, and then hack-back to learn about the malicious actor and recover the stolen documents.
Look for the free flag. Get on the scoreboard!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I admit that in a hurry to get points I did not properly read the description of the challenge. I understood that I'll be downloading and reverse-engineering something. But it did not register on my mind that it's actually malware.</p>
<p>The download was a binary that doesn't do anything when run. My first instict was to use <code>strings</code> to look for the flag, which turned out to be correct.</p>
<p><img alt="giving-malware-to-a-noob--defcon-rtv-ctf-covidscammers-writeup-01" src="./images/giving-malware-to-a-noob--defcon-rtv-ctf-covidscammers-writeup-01.png" /></p>
<p>The flag is: <code>TS{freeFlagLookAtMe}</code>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this challenge was already solved by a team member so I did not get the free flag. The second one, is still open though.</p>
<h2 id="syscalls-5-points">Syscalls [5 points]</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>What syscall is hindering your dynamic analysis? Flag is just the syscall, no brackets or anything.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we run the file from within gdb to debug it we get:</p>
<p><img alt="giving-malware-to-a-noob--defcon-rtv-ctf-covidscammers-writeup-02" src="./images/giving-malware-to-a-noob--defcon-rtv-ctf-covidscammers-writeup-02.png" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p>can't debug this, na na na na...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So from the description we are looking for a syscall that is hindering the debugging of the binary. If we want to find out what syscalls are called by a program, we could determine that using the <code>strace</code> command.</p>
<p><img alt="giving-malware-to-a-noob--defcon-rtv-ctf-covidscammers-writeup-03" src="./images/giving-malware-to-a-noob--defcon-rtv-ctf-covidscammers-writeup-03.png" /></p>
<p>Just before the write syscall for the "na na na" message we see:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ptrace(TRACE_TRACEME) = -1 EPERM (Operation not permitted)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm unfamiliar with <code>ptrace</code> so I researched it and tried to understand how it could prevent debugging. I learned that <code>ptrace</code> can be used as an anti-debugging technique as can be seen <a href="https://www.aldeid.com/wiki/Ptrace-anti-debugging">here</a>.</p>
<p>Sure, enough the flag is: <code>ptrace</code>. </p>
<p>I got 5 points from this and I finally have a contribution to my team! Unfortunately, real life prevented me from continuing with the CTF and I had to bow out early.</p>
<h3 id="sidenote-how-to-bypass-ptrace">Sidenote: How to bypass ptrace?</h3>
<p>How does one bypass this anti-debugging feature? <a href="https://dev.to/denisnutiu/bypassing-ptrace-calls-with-ldpreload-on-linux-12jl">Here's one approach</a> that I tried which should work in theory but doesn't. My guess is that this particular binary has an additional way to prevent debugging, like it spawns a child process and it stays there even if you bypass ptrace. I'd have to look into this further in the future.</p>
<h2 id="shared-secrets-150-points">Shared Secrets [150 points]</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The malware creates a shared-memory object and stores a flag inside. Recover the flag. Flag has the TS{} format, you'll know when you get it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I was able to solve this challenge after the CTF preliminaries ended. By this time I was already well rested and have a clearer mind. It was also at this time that I realized that the file is actually a malware and has already infected my machine. Thankfully, I was running a virtual machine which meant I could just revert back to an old working restore point.</p>
<p>Knowing that the file is a malware, the next step I did was to run <code>rkhunter</code> to look for rootkits and suspcious files. This gave me an interesting finding:</p>
<p><img alt="giving-malware-to-a-noob--defcon-rtv-ctf-covidscammers-writeup-04" src="./images/giving-malware-to-a-noob--defcon-rtv-ctf-covidscammers-writeup-04.png" /></p>
<p>Opening the suspicious file revealed this: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>KRJXW22FMVYES5CTMVBXERKUNNCWK4CJORJWCRTFFZGXERTSGBSE6IL5</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is not the flag yet, it needs to be in the "TS{}" format as instructed in the challenge description.</p>
<p>I initially had a hard time figuring out how to decode this. It wasn't <code>base64</code> nor any other popular encoding. Thankfully, there are tools like <a href="https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/">CyberChef</a> to help with this kind of problem. After some experimentation, the "magic" recipe did the trick and revealed to me that it was actually a <code>base32</code> encoding.</p>
<p><img alt="giving-malware-to-a-noob--defcon-rtv-ctf-covidscammers-writeup-05" src="./images/giving-malware-to-a-noob--defcon-rtv-ctf-covidscammers-writeup-05.png" /></p>
<p>This gave me the flag: <code>TS{kEepItSeCrETkEepItSaFe.MrFr0dO!}</code></p>
<h2 id="license-and-registration-100-points">License and Registration [100 points]</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The malware creates a UUID and stores it in a file, what is the name of this file. Provide the SHA1 hash of hte full path as the flag.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So the description above says that a file is created by the malware and stores data inside of it. I figured that the easiest way to figure out what this created file is to: </p>
<ul>
<li>Restore to a previous restore point before I opened the malware</li>
<li>Run the malware, and then;</li>
<li>Inspect which other files were created at the time of execution. </li>
</ul>
<p>I found out which files were recently created during the last 2 minutes using the following command:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span>find<span class="w"> </span>/<span class="w"> </span>-user<span class="w"> </span>kali<span class="w"> </span>-mmin<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">2</span><span class="w"> </span>-type<span class="w"> </span>f<span class="w"> </span><span class="m">2</span>&gt;<span class="w"> </span>/dev/null
</code></pre></div>

<p>This showed me a lot of files, but after sifting through that I found one file that seesm promising.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>/tmp/.serverauth.tn6aUcM0uM</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To get the flag I did this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>$<span class="w"> </span><span class="nb">echo</span><span class="w"> </span>-n<span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">&quot;/tmp/.serverauth.tn6aUcM0uM&quot;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">|</span><span class="w"> </span>sha1sum
</code></pre></div>

<p>Which resulted in this flag: <code>5b4e97047851682649a602ad62ba4af567e352a3</code></p>
<h2 id="to-be-continued">To be continued?</h2>
<p>So I wanted to try and work on the other challenges but it seems that <a href="https://ctf.threatsims.com">the ctf site</a> is currently down. The site redirected to a different non https site and it spooked me so I stopped trying. Good thing that I had NoScript on.</p>
