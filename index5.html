            <p>When I first learned about <a href="http://synthcode.com/wiki/chibi-scheme">Chibi</a>, an embeddable scheme that allows scripting on C programs, I immediately tried it out on my game engine. I was able to make it work with my existing APIs but I kept on running against segfaults and memory issues. The community was helpful in answering my questions as I tried to track down the cause of the bug, but I eventually gave up out of frustration.</p>
<p>I then learned about <a href="http://wiki.call-cc.org/eggref/5/bind">Chicken Scheme</a>, a somewhat competitor to Chibi that does the same thing but with a larger community and more documentation. I checked it out and liked it so I went ahead and implemented it.</p>

<p>Thankfully I have not experienced any segfaults anymore. It's not because Chicken is better (I don't know well enough of the two to make a good comparison) but because I've come to better understand how to properly structure my code …</p>

            <p>I've long wondered if I should add a scripting language to <a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel/Rebel-Game-Engine">my game engine</a>. I know that most game engines could do without such a feature but I just recently came across <a href="https://github.com/ashinn/chibi-scheme">Chibi-Scheme</a>, a library that allows the use of Scheme lisp scripting for C programs. </p>
<p>I like Lisp. I use it a lot when customizing my Emacs environment (<a href="https://github.com/accidentalrebel?tab=repositories&amp;q=&amp;type=&amp;language=emacs+lisp">using ELisp</a>). There's something about it's syntax and different way to structure programs that appeals to my programmer brain. I've toyed with other Lisp flavors but never had a strong enough reason to continue using them. With Chibi-scheme I may have found that reason.</p>
<p><img alt="thinking-of-adding-lisp-to-my-custom-game-engine-01" src="./images/thinking-of-adding-lisp-to-my-custom-game-engine-01.jpg" /></p>
<p>I am aware that Lisp is not as widespread as Lua or Javascript. And that choosing it might limit the number of potential people to try out my game engine. But as I've been telling myself over and over, this is a self-learning project. So it's okay …</p>

            <p>Our latest game, HistoHunters, has grown into a really big project that compilation now takes a really long time. Longer than no sane programmer wants it to be. It has gotten so bad that changing a single file would take about a minute for recompilation! </p>
<p>Thankfully, I have managed to shorten this wait time through the use of <a href="https://coffeebraingames.wordpress.com/2018/01/21/reducing-compile-time-in-unity-using-assembly-definition-files/">assembly definitions</a>. If you have a big Unity project and compile times are slow, this is the solution to that. Just for kicks I also purchased an SSD and that also helped reduce compile times (Not much as the assembly definitions though).</p>
<p>However, in spite of these changes compiling still takes a few seconds to reload scripts. This seems to be the lowest it could go. While this is definitely better, I can't help but feel that the seconds spent waiting is wasted.</p>

<p>I've recently embarked on a mission to fully integrate <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> with my Unity game development environment. One feature that I wanted to have is the ability to open Unity scripts and text-based files in Emacs instead of MonoDevelop. This is an easy task for supported external editors but for those who aren't (Like Emacs), doing something like this is a bit tricky.</p>
<p>Setting <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Invoking-emacsclient.html">emacsclient</a> as the external editor works in opening the files but the line number is not passed at all (Or is not received by emacs. <a href="https://forum.unity.com/threads/external-editor-arguments-issue.350473/">Seems to be a bug</a>). This means that opening files in the Project Window works but you would not be able to to jump to lines that have errors from the Console. This, of course, is unacceptable.</p>
<p><img alt="02" src="https://i.imgur.com/8gcVuom.png" /></p>
<p>I've tried a number of different solutions. A lot of them are hacky but clever. There was this one option of setting a <a href="https://github.com/bbbscarter/EmacsProxy">Sublime Text …</a></p>

<p>I usually dreaded being asked how long a programming task will take. I always seem to have the knack to overshoot no matter how hard I try. This is an all too common scenario that programmers face and is something that is considered to be a difficult, if not impossible, problem to solve.</p>

<p>This all changed when I was introduced to a helpful system that helps in producing estimates that are "accurate enough".

Since then I've used this system …</p>

<p>It is a well known adage among programmers that premature optimization is the root of all evil. If this is true then I must have been very close to the devil himself.</p>
<p>During the early months of development on Chef Wars I did my best to optimize my code as much as possible. We were making a big game and I wanted to have a stable foundation to build our game on. I obsessed over lots of things from the interconnection of the various systems to folder structures. I was happy with all that I've built …</p>

<li>All data in our game is contained in one excel file we call the "Universe".</li>

<p>Before we started development on Chef Wars, Cliff, my co-founder and game designer for the team, already had pages of spreadsheets containing important values in the game. It's kinda like a game design document but in the form of tables, columns, and rows. This "Universe" file contained everything from stats, dialogue, competitions, locations, chefs, and enemies just to name a few. </p>

Copy and pasting from Windows to Emacs works without any problems so it's weird it does not work the other way around.</p>

Instead of copying each entry by hand and pasting to an org-page new page buffer I decided to make an elisp code that would do it automatically which can be seen below:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">defun</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">arebel-org-journal-entry-to-org-page-post</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="s">&quot;Copy the org-journal entry at point and then convert it to a org-page new post buffer.&quot;</span>

</code></pre></div>

<p>The function is simple and uses functions from org-mode and org-page.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, it checks if the current buffer is in org-journal-mode</li>
<li>Then it gets the headline text and entry texts</li>
<li>It then calls op/new-post. It does it interactively so that it will trigger the prompts needed to …</li></ul>

            <p>I needed a way to minify JSON files from Emacs so I made the short function below.</p>

<p>The function is very simple. First it deletes the whitespaces for the whole current buffer then removes every newline.</p>
<p>This effectively turns this:</p>
